It was a pretty lonely place alongside #GeorgeChristensen in Federal Parliament this afternoon as we were the ONLY 2 MPs to vote to proceed with ‘No💉Passports Bill 2021’ to BAN 💉passports

That’s the 2 of us in the red circle &amp;  everyone else on the other side voting against us https://t.co/13Az6NBsR3
As Leader of the United Australia Party I’ll be doing everything POLITICALLY to BAN 💉 passports

💉 Passports 👇

➡️ are USELESS because 💉 people can still get infected &amp; spread it

➡️ represent medical APARTHEID

➡️ are DISCRIMINATORY

➡️ DIVIDE our society

STOP 💉 COERCION https://t.co/SWWkFfgs45
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG

For Police to ABUSE bail system to stop political opposition to their State supreme leader &amp; political party

Courts must step in to STOP bail conditions being ABUSED for POLITICAL purposes

Political free speech is guaranteed under Australian Constitution https://t.co/HnsP7rD5pK
Beyond words ...

We have scenes of brutal &amp; nasty, if not, illegal use of excessive force by Police

And it looks like they’re having a PARTY

Just ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING double standards

Police are out of control &amp; destroying the fabric of our DEMOCRACY
https://t.co/tyN6ZnFHaf
Our political democracy is under attack by rogue supreme leaders &amp; Police

Both have become particularly NASTY with Police ABUSING the bail system to strip citizens of their Liberty, Freedoms &amp; livelihood

Police abuses of power are growing and are a BIG threat to democracy https://t.co/HnsP7rD5pK
No one is above the law

Tyrant supreme leaders &amp; health ministers are accountable to the Courts AND at the BALLOT BOX

They must STOP trashing our fundamental human right of freely given #InformedConsent

We’ll fight them in the Courts &amp; at the next election

UNITED WE STAND !! https://t.co/ERYGsjxnBu
Great to see a legal challenge to mandatory💉requirements for some NSW workers has been launched in NSW Supreme Court

STOP💉COERCION !! https://t.co/TDlhEmpHoN
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG

SHAME on you Qld Supreme Leader

For allowing 100-strong NRL contingent to arrive into Qld despite 2-week pause on all interstate arrivals because Qld’s quarantine was ‘full’

AND then you treat a cancer patient APPALLINGLY

HYPOCRITE
https://t.co/rzprBLxXG0

Is the Qld Supreme Leader that heartless ??

The lack of humanity shown to this poor woman is despicable &amp; a crime against humanity

The real question is why are The Guardian intentionally and knowingly printing lies and false information? 

In the past, left wing publications would treat Big Pharma as the enemy and seek to hold them to account. 

So why is The Guardian doing Big Pharma’s dirty work ?
The Guardian may argue that the WHO doesn’t recommend HCQ.

They may argue that it’s banned in 🇦🇺 to treat 🦠

They may argue that some studies have found it ineffective

But to publish there is ‘’no evidence’’ (pretending that 193 studies don’t exist) is a deception. It’s a lie.
It’s one thing to innocently publish falsehoods because you are ill-formed

But it’s another to publish falsehoods, when YOU KNOW they are untrue

The Guardian claims there is ‘no evidence’ that HCQ works. That’s a lie. 

There are 195 published studies showing that it does. https://t.co/nbw5niX0hS
Believing in a policy of ‘Lockdown, Mask &amp; Inject’ while ignoring Ivermectin will be recorded as the greatest mass delusion in history.

BUT data at https://t.co/F5l4zQ3a1M shows that people are getting sick from 💉 side effects

@HappyMa84218053 If the CFR for the unvaxed remained the same before the mass vaccination program started, but for the double 💉 it came down - we could give the credit to 💉.

But have a look at the data ..... https://t.co/WiWPd7qSvd
@HappyMa84218053 The way to answer this, is to have a look at the most recent case fatality (CFR) rates for the double 💉 and the unvaxed.
@HappyMa84218053 Oh dear, sounds like you’ve joined the cult.

Yes, there is a lower rate of deaths &amp; hospitalisations, but is this due to Delta variant becoming dominant, or is it due to the vaccines, or a bit of both?
UK : 42,302 new daily cases. 

No wonder their dashboard experienced a delay, they needed more time to count them all.

Yet we have a destructive groupthink in Australia, a delusion, that if only we had mass injections like the UK, we’d low infection numbers. https://t.co/AnTvwT7hcv
Oops. Something appears to have gone amiss

The more they inject, the ⬆️ the new daily cases numbers go - the exact opposite of what the glossy colour brochure said

At what point does someone call out, ‘’the emperor has no clothes’’ ?

Can we get a refund from the 💉 sellers ? https://t.co/kmLKJHJ5rs
@tbooth_98 @normanswan Hate to break it to you, but more of the 💉 are hospitalised. https://t.co/Q05RNcxunM

Subject : The Great 💉 Fallacy

Question : 
For the week 27 June – 3 July 2021, Israel reported  919 new 🦠covid infections in citizens aged 20 and over. 

What percentage of those new 🦠infections were of people ‘’Fully Vaccinated’’ ?
“Immediately within an hour I had tingling down my arm…by the time I got home, my vision was blurry &amp; double,” Dressen said.

It’s a cult.

Our government agencies have been hijacked by a cult of Vaxinists. 

And there is no appeasing this cult. They will not stop until they have injected their experimental genetic agent into the arms of every child. 

Get ready to fight, we must stop them. https://t.co/tYQwMKyRLb
They keep saying “safe &amp; effective”

BUT according to data at https://t.co/F5l4zQ3a1M, 218,852 out of 384,120 people reported an adverse side effect after a 2nd Pfizer dose

https://t.co/064qwNv76u
Poll finds people believe there’s a 38% chance of dying from the Delta strain

Fact : Data shows Delta’s case fatality rate is 0.2% in general (about 200 times less) &amp; even lower for people un-jabbed at 0.13% &amp;  just 0.03% for unjabbed ⬇️ 50 year olds.

@Adam_Creighton The bottom line is, that the data is clear as mud.
@Adam_Creighton On the ‘benefit’ that’s based on the original alpha variant - now we are dealing with delta - which is showing around 75% less deadly. 

The benefit also doesn’t make any allowance for early treatment. 

And on the risk - that’s doesn’t include the unknown long term risk.
What a joke. All these useless MP’s gave tens of thousands of taxpayers $ to Facebook to buy likes

Report indicates more "breakthrough" cases, where you can still get infected even after being FULLY vaccinated, showing up in vaccinated women

So you &amp; people around you can still get infected

NO point to a "vaccine passport"

https://t.co/yfVrf9eEyK
So people are STILL tragically dying after being infected even AFTER being fully vaccinated

These "breakthrough" cases mean that "vaccine passports" are MISLEADING &amp; DANGEROUS as people may feel totally safe when they can STILL get infected !!!

Geert Vanden Bossche, DMV, PhD : ‘’mass vaccination with leaky Covid-19 vaccines in the midst of the pandemic can only breed highly infectious variants’’

https://t.co/kyUYZbRXkL https://t.co/BlIVEQNmX3
Minister for Health Andrew Little announced the amendment to the Medicines Act the day of the ruling. 

He added that the Pfizer vaccine did not need rigorous testing and approval because of the critical need for the vaccine during the pandemic. 🤯🤯
‘’Compelling patients or workers to receive a vaccine which is still investigational would set a significant medical precedent, which would run counter to all international codes of medical ethics since the Nuremberg Code of 1947 and Declaration of Helsinki in 1952’’
The letter also argued that encouraging citizens to have the jab in light of its unproven safety was unethical.
“Nobody currently knows how safe or effective this novel mRNA technology is in the medium to long term,” the letter stated. “Highly credible medical experts around the world, and even some vaccine developers themselves, are predicting problems &amp; raising urgent red-flag concerns’’
Last month, KTI released an open letter signed by 43 New Zealand medical practitioners outlining the case and expressed concern over the promotion of the vaccine despite a lack of evidence demonstrating its safety.
The clinical trial for the vax is not due to be completed until April 2023 - it’s a grand medical experiment 

The NZ Medicines Act only allows an experimental vaccine for a ‘limited number of patients’ - but they want to stick a needle in every arm

Florida Governor DeSantis shows how a real conservative leader tackles calls for domestic ‘’vaccine passports’’. 

https://t.co/GHmZTVeZ10
‘’It is surely the definition of stupidity and/or sinister intent that our governments ban successful, proven safe treatments at the same time as threatening our lives and livelihoods unless we take drugs that have yet to be proven completely safe.’’
‘’On top of which, there are currently proven medical treatments that Australia should be allowing GPs to prescribe to individuals who so desire, such as ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and others’’ .....
It is a fine line between encouraging/incentivising vaccination &amp; coercing it, but telling traumatised Aussies that they can, for example, only visit their loved ones or carry on their normal business if they inject a certain drug is completely unacceptable &amp; indeed reprehensible
‘’the government has no moral, ethical or, arguably, no constitutional right to limit individual freedoms based on medical intervention’’
‘’This is for one simple reason: governments and bureaucracies have no right to enforce or to coerce an individual to take a medical treatment or drug against the individual’s better instincts or judgment’’
‘’Make no mistake; a ‘vaccine passport’ denying liberties &amp; restricting the free movement of Australians within their own country will be potentially the most sinister &amp; disgraceful act by an Australian government against its own people in our history’’ .........
Any number of conventions and laws exist that make it a criminal offence for a government or its bureaucrats to coerce or make mandatory any form of medical treatment against the will of the individual ......
‘’If the PM, Hunt or any members of federal/national Cabinets seek to impose a ‘vaccine passport’ that restricts freedom of movement &amp; liberties of Australians, they will potentially be guilty of human rights abuses &amp; even crimes against humanity’’

23/ We citizens should therefore be wary of the consensus and its mouthpieces, especially when we see them coming. Then, we must also use a degree of skepticism ....
22/ (the spiral of silence) poses a real danger to society and democracy, as the suppression of other voices, whether of the general public or of scientists, could make the distorted and invented or fabricated reality into a real reality.
21/ when the media aligns with the fictitious consensus dictated to them,this leads to a distortion of the distribution of opinions in society, &amp; so the number of those who refrain from supporting an incompatible opinion increases &amp; a SPIRAL OF EVER-EXPANDING SILENCE IS CREATED
20/ Since most persons do not want to be an exception, they will choose to remain silent or straighten a line and express an opinion that is consistent with what they perceive as the majority opinion ...
19/ The prevailing tendency of most people is to match their expressed opinions to what they perceived as acceptable &amp; agreed upon by the public. Individuals, who estimate that their opinion is different from the majority opinion, will usually refrain from expressing it in public
18/ According to the theory, which has been demonstrated in many studies, most people are anxious about a state of social and ideological isolation and are afraid to express themselves in an ideologically hostile environment ...
17/ The powerful ability of the media to create a simulated dictated consensus has been well described in the theory of THE SPIRAL OF SILENCE known in the academic literature in the field of communication ...
16/The vast majority of the media channels abandoned their traditional role defending democracy and even aligned themselves with the pseudo-consensus dictated from above, which is unscientific by virtue of being dictated ....
15/  This, using the improper means mentioned above of ridiculing, silencing, and suppressing any attempt to express an opposing opinion or one that casts doubt on the official position. ....
14/ One of the measures taken by the authorities since the beginning of the corona crisis is a sweeping takeover of public discourse and the creation of a false representation of a scientific consensus. 

This, using the improper means mentioned above of ridiculing, silencing ...
13/ The mainstream media now serving as spokespersons for these interested parties without examining things in depth as is required of journalists in democratic &amp; free countries. 

This is a dangerous phenomenon that is a slippery slope .....
12/ These silencing &amp;repression moves have many partners, &amp; are driven by powerful groups with economic &amp;  political interests, which support each other in order to continue to control the current agenda – governments, health authorities, (big Pharma) and the mainstream media..
11/ This phenomenon of suppressing and silencing of doctors, whose positions are contrary to those of the establishment ....is no doubt that it is gaining momentum and worsening today ....
10/ Doctors, who expressed a critical stance regarding the vaccine &amp; / or the coercion policy and the green passport outline, received warning letters from the ministry of health and some were even targets of defamation campaigns in the media

This phenomenon of suppressing ...
9/Like a virus that takes over a cell and makes it as its own until completely destroying it, so politics invaded the sanctity of the medical system and infiltrated it with a means of intimidation, paralysis of medical discretion, and silencing scientific discourse ...
8/In their propaganda to encourage vaccination, the health system officials in charge of the public safety sadly have appeared more than once as salespeople trying their best to pitch their products, while exaggerating their advantages and intentionally hiding their downsides ..
7/  as part of the aggressive propaganda to encourage the Israeli public to vaccinate against the coronavirus, senior officials of the ministry of health declare firmly that the vaccine is safe and risk free, while knowing it is IMPOSSIBLE to evaluate its (full) safety .....
6/The (novel &amp; experimental) Pfizer COVID vaccine was given to the Israeli citizens without receiving their informed consent &amp; without giving them information about the vaccine's safety, potential risks, possible side effects, expected efficiency, &amp; MEDICAL ALTERNATIVES ......
5/Is it possible that the state leaders of Israel suffer from an uncontrollable impulse to vaccinate the entire population, which arises from their need to be portrayed as the saviors of the people ......

(Sounds familiar)
4/In psychology, an ‘impulse control disorder’ is defined as an unstoppable inner need of a person to perform a certain action even knowing it may harm oneself or others. ...
3/After analyzing the preliminary findings .... we believe there is reason for concern that the multitude of wrongs brought upon the Israeli public during the COVID vac. campaign may be the consequence of a disorder known in psychology as "impulse control disorder’’ ....
2/Based on the information we have gathered from the public &amp; many other sources, we were exposed to a wide range of severe wrongs caused to the public since the COVID vaccination campaign in Israel began. These wrongs are spread across all areas of life &amp; are characterized ...
Worth a read .. 

1/ The Israeli People’s Committee is an independent and apolitical group of Israeli citizens, who vary in their worldviews and areas of expertise. Among us there are physicians, lawyers, scientists &amp; researchers .....
