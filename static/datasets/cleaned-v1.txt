So, we can allow host of Celebrity Apprentice to travel from UK to Australia to record another TV series BUT stranded Aussies CAN’T get back home

So @GladysB you tell us💉 is the ONLY answer

BUT CEO of Pfizer tells us success ‘likely to require both 💉 AND treatments’

Who do we believe ??

@7NewsSydney @newscomauHQ @9NewsSyd @10NewsFirstSyd @BenFordhamLive @jmodoh @dailytelegraph @smh @australian @SkyNewsAust @aclennell 
DISGUSTING double standards by Morrison

While we were locked up & COULDN’T travel for Father’s Day, Morrison travels for Father’s Day

SHAME

COMPLETELY out of touch

CAN’T trust Morrison

CAN’T trust the Libs

#VoteOUTLiberals


So @JohnBarilaroMP says curfews don’t work

So @GladysB will you end curfews in Western Sydney NOW ??

STOP discriminating against people in Western Sydney

STOP dividing our society

STOP the medical segregation & apartheid

END the curfews NOW


Alternatives, what alternatives ?

Maybe helpful for all of us, even fully💉in ICU

Israeli study finds antiviral FDA-approved drug Fenofibrate (Tricor), an oral medication to help lower cholesterol, has also lowered severe progressive inflammation markers

Alternatives, what alternatives ?

Early treatment ?

Who would have thought ?

Antiviral pill ?

May even be helpful for fully💉in ICU

May even be a big $$ maker for Pfizer

Big Pharma doesn’t let hypocrisy & double standards get in the way of making $$$

STOP 💉 coercion 

STOP 💉 passports

STOP medical segregation & apartheid 

You just CAN’T TRUST Dictator Dan

You just CAN’T TRUST Vic Labor

TIME to fight for our FREEDOMS

Join me in the political fight

Police are simply OUT OF CONTROL

With rogue cops trying to access QR check-in data SIX times to solve crimes before being stopped

More evidence that Police are using ‘health’ as an excuse to get more ‘Police’ powers

DISGUSTING

STOP Police State

As Leader of the United Australia Party I’ll be doing everything POLITICALLY to BAN 💉 passports

💉 Passports 👇

➡️ DIVIDE our society

➡️ are DISCRIMINATORY

➡️ represent medical APARTHEID

➡️ are USELESS because 💉 people can still get infected & spread it

STOP 💉 COERCION 
Time to get rid of 🤡🤡 running the show

TIME to fight for our FREEDOMS

Join me in the political fight

DISGUSTING thieves have stolen nearly $500 worth of play equipment from front yard of Melbourne home that Mum-of-2 built to make lockdown a little easier

Heartless Dictator Dan puts people in endless lockdown only to have heartless thieves make it harder


“Safe & effective” they say

BUT more than 100 Ontario youth sent to hospital for💉related heart problems

“Rare” they say

BUT what if it was your child that was affected ??

AND fully💉people can STILL get infected & spread it

💉NOT setting us free

ENOUGH of the despicable attempts to divide our society @GladysB 

ONLY allowing fully💉 to attend places of worship is a fundamental attack on our religious freedoms

How dare you divide congregations in such a pathetic worldly way

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME 
You CAN’T trust 🤡🤡🤡 to run the show

Supermarket shelves NOT able to be stocked because of breakdown of supply chains

People locked up overnight because of SHAMEFUL curfews

Economy going down the drain

Ongoing harm to mental harm

SACK the lot of them

#VoteOUTLiberals 
DISGUSTING that medical segregation & apartheid to extend to church attendance

Freedom of religion being trashed by requirement to have💉💉WITH 💉passport as evidence

SHAMEFUL that church goers will need💉passport to pray

BUT fully💉can still get it & spread it

Gladys MUST GO 
Dictator Dan moving to implement medical segregation & apartheid

I thought that Lefties were against segregation & apartheid

You just CAN’T trust Labor

You just CAN’T trust a dictator

You just CAN’T anyone trying to impose medical segregation & apartheid

END the Sydney Curfews NOW

They don’t work so it’s criminal for  those affected by Sydney curfews to continue to be locked up

END the Police State Curfews NOW

END false imprisonment of those affected by curfews NOW

STOP trashing our Democratic Freedoms

A complete 🤡🤡 show

The politicians, health bureaucrats & senior police are fast losing control of NSW & making it up as they go

Anyone with half a brain realises curfews are pointless, don’t work & likely counter-productive

Time to VOTE OUT NSW Libs

Of the 2 photos below, which one is of a supermarket in Caracas, Venezuela under the incompetent totalitarian regime of Hugo Chavez - and which one is of a supermarket in Sydney, Australia under the incompetent totalitarian regime of Gladys Berejiklian ??

SHAME, Gladys, SHAME 
Barilaro is right to hit out over curfews imposed across Greater Sydney saying restriction measures “don’t work”

What a bunch of 🤡🤡

So who came up with idea for curfew ??

Gladys, NSWCHO or NSW Police Commissioner ??

SHAME

Police States have curfews

Gladys losing control of NSW

Supermarket shelves across Sydney looking bare with food shortages emerging as supply chains start breaking down

You’d expect food shortages in communists countries NOT in SYDNEY

Plan A FAILING

ANTIVIRALS Plans B needed NOW


“Curfews don’t work” says Deputy Premier John Barilaro

That’s what happens with 🤡🤡 running the show & making things up as they go

DISGUSTING how they’ve IMPOSED Police-enforced curfews in Local Government Areas of concern across Greater Sydney

SHAME

NSW food distribution grinding to a halt with major supermarkets Coles & Woolworths struggling to overcome supply chain issues with 1000s of workers forced into self-isolation after being deemed close contacts

Time for Plan B or we risk food shortages

Looks like Big Daddy Marxist Mark wants to keep WA locked up indefinitely 

Looks like West Australians are NOT going anywhere until upwards of 90% 💉 rate is reached

Looks like no one going to WA until upwards of 90% reached

They said 💉 would set you free

CON JOB continues 
They tell us here in Australia they’ll open up when magical % of💉people is reached

BUT💉NOT setting Israel free as Israeli Health Ministry announces tightened restrictions ahead of High Holy Days as Israel braces for mass gatherings amid ongoing 4th wave


‘Safe & effective’ they say

What a surprise then that Japanese authorities are moving to RECALL 3 batches of💉after an investigation found stainless steel contaminants in some vials

Seems stainless steel contamination may have occurred during production

How about ‘No entry, NO BUSINESS’

How dare businesses DICTATE to us on OUR personal medical choices

We don’t tell them how to run their business, how dare they tell us how to run OUR lives

Looks like they DON’T want OUR business

AND fully💉can still get infected & spread it 
The heartbreaking scenes on the NSW/Qld on Father’s Day prove how heartless & wrong the lockdowns are

Lockdowns & border restrictions are turning our country into a Police State where we’re being locked up & denied our Freedoms contrary to our Australian Constitution

SHAME 
With Israeli health bureaucrat saying 4x 💉💉💉💉 will be needed

What makes you think @GladysB @NSWCHO that 💉 will set NSW free ??

With💉 people ending up in hospital & ICU what makes you think 💉 will set NSW free ?? 

Are you looking for a Plan B ??

They’ll end up using more powers for THEIR benefit to control you MORE so YOU end up in Police State

BE WARNED 
Big Brother & now Big Daddy

Sounding more like the mutual admiration society at a Communist International Congress

Communists always liked big shows of police & military force to enforce hard borders for the ‘benefit’ of their comrade citizens

Sounding more like Marxist Mark

Yes, we’re building a political army to get Australia out of our prison state

Dividing families like this on Father’s Day is WRONG & UNAUSTRALIAN

@GladysB & @AnnastaciaMP should be ashamed of themselves

This scene is reminiscent of Berlin Wall & the way people are being treated daily at the border completes the sad comparison

Tear down this wall NOW !! 
DISGUSTING that ‘our’ leaders are trying to divide us with barriers, borders, walls & restrictions like the communists did 50yrs ago

Of course, the communists justified the division for the benefit & safety of their people

‘Our’ leaders are using the same justification

TRAGIC 
What’s our great nation become when people have to do this on Father’s Day

You’re just heartless @GladysB & @AnnastaciaMP

We should all be able to visit our Fathers at home on Father’s Day

SHAME

You may put up barriers BUT we’ll STOP you from dividing us

UK's vaccine advisory body has REFUSED to give green light to vaccinating healthy children aged 12-15yrs

It said children were at such a low risk from infection that💉would offer only a marginal benefit

Great outcome for science over political expediency

The point when sanity becomes INSANITY

When the rational become IRRATIONAL

When the cultists & the indoctrinated lose the plot

When groupthink drags down society

STOP the scaremongering

STOP the madness

I’d rather freedom of speech & be attacked, than be sheep & be praised

It’s better to be right as an individual, than to be wrong as a group

Our society is falling apart because of sheep wanting to show off💉passport, which will be of NO use if they get infected & end up in ICU 

💉NOT setting Israel free

Israel has long been a world leader in💉efforts BUT the country is now seeing a record number of infections

Surprise, surprise

When will the sheep open their eyes & minds ?

It will be too late if they’re fully💉& end up in ICU

So Gladys says she doesn’t want to hear complaints from unvaccinated residents as those fully💉are afforded ‘greater freedoms’ once the State hits its 70% target

Well, Gladys there WILL be complaints NOW & at the NEXT ELECTION

New Israeli research suggests natural immunity from being infected & recovering provided Israelis with longer-lasting protection against the Delta variant than 💉💉 given early this year

Highly💉Israel was down to a handful of daily cases BUT now it's around 11,000

What happened ?? 

A very good question that @GladysB & @NSWCHO should be asking

💉NOT setting Israel free

CON JOB continues

Time for Plan B

NSW Police investigating themselves for possible Public Health Order breaches after photos of a Police PARTY emerge

I wonder how that will turn out 🤔

NSW Police are out of control with GROUP PARTIES & drunken senior cop misbehaving

DISGUSTING



“Disappointment” that NSW Deputy Police Commissioner had “brought the office into question” by collapsing drunk and then swearing at paramedics who tried to help him

DISGUSTING

Police are out of control & think they’re not accountable

DISGRACEFUL

Ever wondered how Police try to stitch someone up ??

Surely, they wouldn’t try to fabricate charges ??

Surely, they wouldn’t engage in a criminal conspiracy to stitch someone up ??

Surely, they wouldn’t misuse bail conditions to stitch someone up ??

Listen & learn

WRONG, WRONG, WRONG

For Police to ABUSE bail system to stop political opposition to their State supreme leader & political party

Courts must step in to STOP bail conditions being ABUSED for POLITICAL purposes

Political free speech is guaranteed under Australian Constitution 
Beyond words ...

We have scenes of brutal & nasty, if not, illegal use of excessive force by Police

And it looks like they’re having a PARTY

Just ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING double standards

Police are out of control & destroying the fabric of our DEMOCRACY

Our political democracy is under attack by rogue supreme leaders & Police

Both have become particularly NASTY with Police ABUSING the bail system to strip citizens of their Liberty, Freedoms & livelihood

Police abuses of power are growing and are a BIG threat to democracy 
No one is above the law

Tyrant supreme leaders & health ministers are accountable to the Courts AND at the BALLOT BOX

They must STOP trashing our fundamental human right of freely given #InformedConsent

We’ll fight them in the Courts & at the next election

ABSOLUTELY disgraceful

BUT highly 💉 Israel & US no longer considered 'epidemiologically safe' for travel to EU

European Council advising EU member states to reimpose restrictions on Israeli & US travellers 🤔

We’re told ‘we’re in this together’

BUT not financially !!

Businesses, workers, families are struggling financially, BUT looks like NOT Dictator Dan & ‘our’ other ‘leaders’

DISGUSTING

I’ll be moving a Private Member’s Bill to reduce Federal MPs & Senior bureaucrats to $750pw 
Those pushing for lockdowns should hang their head in shame

The untold damage to the community & mental health will be felt for years

Time to have the full picture NOT relentless scaremongering sadly having a devastating impact on mental health

VERY SAD

They’ve no idea about the actual extent of mental harm they’re causing the community

Sadly, mental harm is growing at a rapid rate with mental health support groups receiving record number of calls

Lockdowns & halt on other medical procedures causing considerable mental harm 
URGENT need for PLAN B

With growing concerns a new variant detected in South Africa could be resistant to💉after study revealed it may be more infectious & moves 'twice as fast' as other variants including Delta

Need to open mind to Plan B to save lives

You CAN’T trust them when they say they’ll lift lockdowns & restrictions when we’re ‘highly’💉

Just look at highly💉Israel 

Looks like they’re IMPOSING new restrictions ahead of their High Holy Days & school year

ANTIVIRALS Plan B urgently needed 

More VAGUE promises

More LIES & DECEPTION

Drip feeding info to keep CON JOB going

They’ll say ANYTHING to FOOL you

BUT Lockdowns will continue, restrictions will continue

Look at highly💉Israel with their ongoing restrictions

CAN’T trust the Liberals

Accurate AND unbiased information is ESSENTIAL in understanding any health risks

CRITICAL that numbers are not INFLATED to scaremonger & promote a particular agenda

CON JOB continues

Tell us the TRUTH @GladysB

How many infected people in NSW Hospitals have had💉 ?? 

#DefundABC

People waking up to ABC left-wing bias, unconscious assumptions & #groupthink

“Critics think such reporting reflects the ABC’s left-wing biases. While no doubt true of some, I think unconscious assumptions and groupthink are bigger factors”


Another sad tragedy with NZ woman passing away from heart inflammation after getting 💉

“Rare” we’re told

Would be very hard to explain that to any family

But, the health bureaucrats stubbornly stick to Plan A & ignore antivirals

SHAME

Time for Plan B

AND you can’t trust Dan either

Under Dictator Dan it’s not only the curve that gets flattened

Jobs get flattened

Morale gets flattened

Economy gets flattened

Businesses get flattened

Shame, Dan, SHAME !! 
DISGUSTING HYPOCRISY from Palaszczuk regime

Allowing chartered plane with NRL players’ families & officials to travel to Qld DESPITE pausing hotel quarantine for 2 weeks

As Orwell said in Animal Farm ‘All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others’

DISGRACEFUL 
Shows how much Gladys & the Liberal Party have lost their way & have even trashed their so-called Liberal Party values

The Libs have destroyed freedom of choice

The Libs have destroyed small business

The Libs have destroyed our NSW economy

You CAN’T trust the Libs

DISGUSTING 
Great to see the Church community coming together so strongly to stand up for our democratic rights & freedoms

Say NO to 💉 mandates

Say NO to 💉 passports

Say NO to 💉 discrimination

Say NO to MEDICAL APARTHEID

UNITED WE STAND

DISGUSTING how @GladysB is dividing our society

DISGUSTING how Gladys is introducing medical apartheid

DISGUSTING how Gladys is encouraging employers to engage in infectious diseases discrimination which is against the law in NSW

STOP trashing our Freedoms

STOP 💉 Coercion 
NEVER FORGET how ‘our’ political leaders have locked us up, ruined our businesses, harmed our mental health & devastated our economy

You just CAN’T trust them

They’re dividing our society

They’re coercing us about our PERSONAL medical choices

They’re creating a police state 
There you go !!

@NSWCHO telling us we need to ‘get used to’ ongoing💉for the future

They said💉would set us free

CON JOB continues

They’re telling us they want💉after 💉after💉

With NO END in sight

They’re lost control BUT sticking with Plan A

LIES & DECEPTION continue 
You just CAN’T trust the Liberals

NOT surprising support for Lib/Nat coalition has FALLEN to its lowest level since before the last federal election, according to latest Newspoll, as large parts of Australia remain in lockdown

STOP trashing our FREEDOMS

My Private Member’s Bill will incorporate Article 6.1 of the ‘Universal Declaration on Bioethics & Human Rights’ into Australian law to protect our fundamental Human Right of prior, free and informed consent based on adequate information

#InformedConsent 
I have proudly introduced a Private Member’s Bill to incorporate Article 6.1 of the ‘Universal Declaration on Bioethics & Human Rights’ into Australian law to protect our fundamental Human Right of prior, free and informed consent based on adequate information

DISGUSTING how Liberal & Labor 🤡🤡 are destroying our once proud international reputation with their TYRANNY

Sad OUR Human Rights record is being questioned because of the Police State we’re now living in

Out of control Police abusing their powers

Out of control Politicians 
The CON JOB continues

Gladys will say & do ANYTHING to get people to get💉

Promises, threats, coercion all part of the CON JOB

Problem is that fully💉can still get it & can still spread it so restrictions are here to stay

AND sadly fully💉can still end up in hospital & ICU 
UNITED WE STAND

Freedom over Fear
Liberty over Lockdowns 
Choice over Coercion 

If that’s what you believe in, help us fight the tyranny being imposed by Labor & Liberal Parties

JOIN the UNITED AUSTRALIA PARTY

I stand with hundreds of church leaders AND thousands of church members & attendees who’ve signed an open letter to Morrison opposing the implementation of💉passport system in Australia

UNITED WE STAND

I’ve already moved a Federal Bill to BAN💉passports

Let’s all support NSW teachers who believe people should be able to choose what medical procedures & interventions they have without losing their job

Let’s all support the basic human right of freedom of choice

Let’s all STOP medical apartheid

👇👇👇


DISGUSTING @GladysB that you would promote medical APARTHEID

We’re ALL Australians AND we’re ALL equal

STOP your infectious diseases discrimination 

STOP dividing our society

We’re ALL in this TOGETHER remember !! 
SHAME @GladysB SHAME

Infectious diseases discrimination is against the law, according to Anti-Discrimination NSW, a NSW government body that administers the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW)

💉mandates DISCRIMINATE on the basis of infectious disease

There you go

CON JOB continues

Double dose was meant to set us free

But that was a CON

Now talking about booster

You just CAN’T trust them

There’ll be more doses

Big Pharma has them under an evil $$ spell

At the United Australia Party we’re fighting to break that spell !! 
We’ve enjoyed a free ride throughout our lives so far

BUT now it’s our turn to FIGHT for our FREEDOMS

Join us @ the United Australia Party

Freedom over Fear
Liberty over Lockdowns

JOIN me in the political FIGHT of our lives

The END of WA Libs

Report finds unethical, underhanded & corrupt practices have left WA Liberals a penniless ‘political wasteland’ on the verge of ‘extinction’

All disaffected Libs around the country are welcome to join me @ the United Australia Party !!

United Australia Party was originally founded in 1931 & has won 4 Federal elections

It’s had two elected PMs – Joseph Lyons & Robert Menzies (1939–1941)

It’s always stood for continued freedom of the individual

If you believe in Freedom join us

👇👇👇


Lies & deception from the Libs

Liberal Party’s website contains a section “Our Beliefs”

It contains LIES

To say you believe in the “inalienable rights and freedoms of all peoples" is a CON JOB when you’re engaging in💉 COERCION

You CAN’T trust the Liberals !! 
Our Australian Constitution is the ONLY document we should need to travel freely within Australia

That was & REMAINS fundamental to our Federation 

God help any politician who tries to take away that right from us

We’ll fight them in the Courts, Parliament & at the BALLOT BOX 
Stubborn refusal of health bureaucrats to even consider Ivermectin is just criminal & must go to Court

Italians going that way like US

Only a matter of time before that happens here in Australia

With fully💉people ending up in ICU families will be going to court to save lives 
Sad when anyone ends up in ICU

But what do you say when fully💉person ends up in ICU

Sadly, on overseas experience this will happen more given “breakthrough” infections do occur where fully💉people still get infected & get seriously ill

What medical treatments do you give them 
We must always remember that our ANZACs fought so bravely to protect our freedoms & liberties

Lest We Forget 🇦🇺 
Medical Apartheid is WRONG @GladysB

💉coercion is WRONG

Fully💉can STILL get infected and SPREAD IT

💉passports are dangerously misleading as Fully💉can STILL get infected and SPREAD IT

AND Infectious Diseases Discrimination is against the law in NSW


TGA has so far received 89 reports mentioning Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) occurring after getting AstraZeneca in Australia
 
TGA states that the WARNING added to AZ’s Product Information is a ‘precautionary measure’

‘Rare’ of course

BUT

Be warned ⚠️

Ambulance service at crisis levels 

Hospitals at crisis levels

Economy at crisis levels

Mismanagement of NSW at crisis levels

Definitely time for FRESH APPROACH @GladysB & @NSWCHO

Urgent need for the ANTIVIRALS to stop the pain & suffering and deaths

Nothing to lose !! 
Freedom over Fear
Liberty over Lockdowns
Choice over Coercion 

If that’s what you believe in, then help us fight the TYRANY being imposed by the Labor & Liberal Parties

JOIN us @ the UNITED AUSTRALIA PARTY

👇👇👇


KEEP saying NO to💉 mandates

Personal medical choices are PERSONAL medical choices without fear of losing your job

DISGUSTING how Gladys is trying to divide us

DON’T let her !!

I stand with teachers who are PRO-FREE CHOICE

Let’s SUPPORT THEM

👇👇👇

DISGUSTING what’s happening to NSW under Gladys

NSW Ambulances unable to keep up with demand after 000 lines flooded with "unnecessary" pandemic-related calls

Our health system is in crisis after her mismanagement AND relentless scaremongering

SHAME !!

So sad a fully💉flight attendant passed away after getting infected

AND he took every precaution including wearing a mask, constantly washing his hands, sanitizing surfaces & wiping everything down in hotel rooms

A tragic reminder💉is not setting us free

Thank you to all those letting me know they’ve resigned from the Liberal Party because it has lost it’s way

If you want to join the fight for Freedom then join us

@ the United Australia Party

We will=&gt;

&gt;BAN💉mandates & passports
&gt;STOP lockdowns

👇👇👇

WRONG that Qantas employees are being forced to get💉with backing of ScoMo

💉COERCION amounts to blackmail, extortion, discrimination & assault where true INFORMED CONSENT not given

You CAN’T trust the Liberals & Nationals

They’re trashing our Freedoms

Looks like Infectious Diseases Discrimination is against the law

It’s when you’re treated unfairly because:

&gt;you may acquire an infectious disease in future

&gt;people think you have an infectious disease

&gt;you used to have an infectious disease

👇👇👇


Have you been ABANDONED by the Liberal, Labor, Nationals & Greens TOTALITARIAN parties

Then come & join me in the political FIGHT FOR FREEDOM 

@ the United Australia Party

We will =&gt;

&gt;BAN💉mandates & passports
&gt;STOP lockdowns

UNITED WE STAND

👇👇👇

You have to wonder when people label opponents ‘conspiracy theorists’

It’s a label used to ridicule opponents & help people avoid a debate they may lose with the theorists

Like Watergate, ‘conspiracy theories’ can actually turn out to be TRUE

Let the facts speak for themselves 
Lest We Forget all the sacrifices of our brave ANZACs to protect our Freedoms & Australian way of life 🇦🇺 
TELL US the daily numbers @GladysB !!

How many infected people in NSW Hospitals had got 💉 ?

How many mystery cases are currently floating around NSW ?

How many of the latest cases were infectious while out in the community ?

STOP HIDING THE FACTS

So💉may NEVER set us free

Expert warns new variants could be deadlier AND💉evading

“Would be easy to unstitch all of the work done so far if it turns out we do lose immunity because💉wane in their effectiveness”

Cultists BEWARE

ANTIVIRALS Plan B needed


💉Cultists thinking they’re invincible need to THINK AGAIN

UK study finds ‘protection’ for Fully💉is WANING

With a "reduced benefit" of ‘protection’ from both types of💉as months go by

SO you’re NOT invincible & may STILL end up seriously sick or worse 
As leader of the United Australia Party I’ll fight to BAN💉passports

I have already moved a Private Member’s Bill to BAN💉passports

💉passports are dangerously USELESS as💉people can STILL get infected AND still SPREAD it

Join me in the FIGHT !

👇👇👇


Looks like nothing to lose to keep up Vitamin D level

With research showing that infected patients supplemented with vitamin D are more likely to have fewer rates of ICU admission & mortality events

So many alternatives, but Cultists JUST brainwashed by Big Pharma

CRIMINAL 
The SCAREMONGERING is breathtaking

DISGRACEFUL

They’ll say absolutely anything to scare you into getting💉

Health bureaucrats are now just marketing people for Big Pharma

AND Big Pharma laughing all the way to the bank with such a hold on the 🤡🤡 running the show

DISGUSTING 
As leader of the United Australia Party I’ll make sure that we’re TRULY in it together

I’ll be moving a Private Member’s Bill to ensure politicians take a pay cut to $750pw during lockdowns

Aussie families are struggling & ALL MPs need to take a PAY CUT

Join me in the FIGHT

"With endless authoritarian lockdowns, emergence of a police state, censorship & our state borders shut contrary our Federation, I no longer recognise the country I grew up in”

Time to FIGHT for our FREEDOMS

UNITED WE STAND

👇👇👇


WOW, looks like natural immunity can offer STRONGER protection

Who would have thought ??

New study shows natural immunity can confer longer lasting & stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease & hospitalisation

#InformedConsent


You just CAN’T trust NSW Liberal TOTALITARIAN regime

Promises, promises

Lies & deception

Coercion, dividing our society, medical apartheid & segregation

Trashing our Freedoms

Harming our mental health

Destroying our economy

And what about Labor ?

Can’t trust them either 
MORE 💉 COERCION

MORE attacks on the fundamental human right of INFORMED CONSENT

I stand with teachers AND anyone else being COERCED to get💉contrary to #InformedConsent

You CAN’T trust the NSW Liberal TOTALITARIAN regime

They’re trashing our FREEDOMS

This is where Gladys & Brad Hazzard have taken us

MEDICAL APARTHEID

WRONG, WRONG, WRONG 

They’re dividing our society

They’re segregating us

They’re institutionalising discrimination

They’re trashing our DEMOCRACY

TIME TO GO both of you !! 
WRONG that MPs & senior bureaucrats have been getting PAY RISES when struggling Aussies are doing it TOUGH

I will be moving a Private Member’s Bill to reduce Federal MP’s & Senior Public Servant’s pay to $750pw during lockdowns in their State or Territory

We’re in it together ! 
DISGUSTING that NSW Liberal TOTALITARIAN Govt regime now requires you to register your travel in ‘certain circumstances’

Edict states you must carry your ‘travel registration’ with you at all times & show Police if requested

SHAME Gladys for creating Police State

Time to GO !! 
SHAME @GladysB for introducing medical SEGREGATION & APARTHEID 

SHAME Gladys for...

&gt;DIVIDING our Society
&gt;TRASHING our Freedoms &gt;institutionalising DISCRIMINATION

SHAME Gladys for your State-sponsored COERCION

AND for what ?

FULLY💉people CAN still get infected & spread it 
A few thoughts come to mind...

&gt;child abuse
&gt;causing mental harm
&gt;brainwashing in action
&gt;indoctrination 101
&gt;DISGUSTING
&gt;Serves NO purpose
&gt;DESTROYING their childhood

STOP scaremongering about the kids

Let them ENJOY their young lives

Let them have FREEDOM from fear ✔️ 
AND Cultists keep DELUDING themselves that💉will set them free

Highly💉Israel currently has one of the worst rates of biweekly cases per million people globally as it faces Delta

With "most of hospitalised patients actually being💉"

Time for ANTIVIRALS

A real tragedy

Coroner rules that BBC presenter Lisa Shaw, 44, died from brain haemorrhage after ‘complications’ from 💉

Very sad

‘Rare’ but what if it happens to you, a loved one or child ??

Just wrong

With a Sydney hospital in crisis under Gladys’ flawed approach it’s definitely time for FRESH APPROACH

As Leader of the United Australia Party I’d be implementing a large-scale “prophylactic & therapeutic” medical treatment approach giving you REAL choice on possible treatments 
Trusty NSW Police Commissioner gets ANOTHER pay rise

Businesses are on the edge, livelihoods are being destroyed & the mental harm increases every day

Aussies are struggling on $750 pw

AND Senior Public servants get PAY RISES

DISGUSTING 
Welcome to Gladys’ Police state

Where the ‘carrot’ approach takes on a completely new meaning

Where the league of dictators would marvel at the vigour that our supreme leader & her trusty Police Commissioner pursue state-sponsored COERCION

You’ve gone TOO FAR

RESIGN Gladys ! 
Looking like Qantas is on the edge, like so many businesses across Australia

SADDEST part is they think💉will set them free by COERCING employees

BUT💉NOT setting us free

Maybe time to cash out those Frequent Flyer points just in case you LOSE THEM

They say it’s ‘safe & effective’

They say any adverse reactions are ‘rare’

They say it won’t happen to you

THAT’S, of course, until it DOES happen to YOU, a loved one or a child

They’re flogging a product & they’ll say ANYTHING

DON’T be fooled !!

WELL DONE to all those Freedom loving French eating out for their Liberty, Equality, Fraternity

If a business doesn’t want our business, then they can MISS OUT on our business

We need to send a STRONG message to businesses who treat us UNEQUALLY

DON’T give them OUR business 
That Press Release should be the LAST STRAW

Are you kidding me ??

It’s contrary to everything Liberal Party stands (stood) for

Liberal Party has LOST THE PLOT

Time to BURN your LIBERAL PARTY MEMBERSHIP CARD

And JOIN the United Australia Party

👇👇👇

England learning the hard way that💉mandate for care workers is COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

With workers LEAVING the sector or staying away resulting in severe STAFF SHORTAGES

“no jab, no job”policy is COERCION prompting workers to simply walk away 

STOP COERCION

DON’T be fooled !!

Our society is being DIVIDED 

MEDICAL APARTHEID being introduced

And for WHAT ??

There WILL be restrictions REGARDLESS of the %

AND even FULLY💉 can STILL get infected

The % is MEANINGLESS

It’s just a CON JOB

It’s just a GRAB FOR POWER

RESIGN Gladys 
Absolutely DISGUSTING

And UNAUSTRALIAN

Gladys has just introduced Medical APARTHEID into NSW

SHAME Gladys for dividing our Society

SHAME Gladys for taking away our Freedoms

SHAME Gladys for abusing your power

SHAME Gladys for bringing medical APARTHEID to NSW

RESIGN NOW !! 
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE that @GladysB is moving to create a two-tier society

JUST WRONG

We’re all equal AND should be treated EQUALLY

OUR FREEDOMS that our ANZACs died for are NOT conditional on showing our PRIVATE health records

Time to GO Gladys !!

What an ABSOLUTE DISGRACE

@GladysB is MOCKING us with JUST 2 TINY changes to ‘relax’ restrictions

That’s two TINY changes

Gladys is OUT OF CONTROL

She’s keeping us LOCKED UP with vague promises

AND then gives ‘back’ just two TINY Freedoms

DON’T trust her

Time to GO Gladys 
How many people in NSW hospitals have previously got💉 @GladysB @NSWCHO ??

NOT just those in ICU

Have you listened to the warning from Israeli PM ?

Double dosed feeling ‘protected’ but ‘most vulnerable’ as ‘protection fading’

Double dosed young people getting hospitalised 
As Leader of the United Australia Party I would end lockdowns & restrictions by implementing a large-scale “prophylactic & therapeutic” medical treatment approach based on the outstanding work of Prof Thomas Borody

This model has been successful in India

77 yr old woman sailing aboard Carnival cruise ship from Texas to Belize has reportedly died after being infected despite being fully💉

Very sad

People think they’re ‘protected’ but can still get seriously ill or worse

Beware of false sense of security

That people can still get infected & can still be spreaders DESPITE being fully💉 makes 💉passports USELESS & dangerously MISLEADING

AND now looks like they might EXPIRE

Not surprising given Israeli experience with ‘fading protection’

💉NOT setting us free

CON JOB CONTINUES 
Thinking of going on a cruise when you’re fully💉& have your💉passport ??

THINK AGAIN

CDC warns older adults AND travellers in high-risk groups NOT to take cruises, EVEN IF they're FULLY💉

CDC says chance of getting infected on cruise ships is “high” 🤔 
New daily infections in Israel are approaching record levels DESPITE the country’s💉campaign & recent rollout of world’s 1st widespread booster💉

💉NOT setting Israel free

FULLY💉 still getting infected & still getting hospitalised

ANTIVIRALS needed

A warning from Israeli PM

Double dosed feeling ‘protected’ but ‘most vulnerable’ as ‘protection fading’

Double dosed young people getting hospitalised

‘Urgent’ need for 3rd dose

AND there you go, straight from Israeli PM

AND here in Australia we’re NOT being told FULL STORY 
1942 was such a critical year for Australia

Lest We Forget all the sacrifices that were made to protect our Freedoms & way of life 🇦🇺 
Lest We Forget our brave ANZACs who fought so bravely for our Freedoms 🇦🇺 
Police are OUT OF CONTROL & have lost considerable community support across the country

Pointing guns at unarmed protesters

UNAUSTRALIAN

Making up rules as they go along

DISGUSTING

Police harassment & intimidation is WRONG & ILLEGAL 
STOP scaremongering about risk to children

CRIMINAL to try to rush decisions especially in relation to children

Why put fit & healthy children at RISK ??

CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY !! 
With NSW Hospitals struggling with cases, it’s now time for ‘our’ political leaders to talk to Prof Thomas Borody

With NSW hospitals in crisis there’s nothing to lose to chat with a world class medical expert like Prof Borody

We need a FRESH APPROACH NOW

My office can organise a formal Anniversary Message for my Hughes constituents celebrating a special milestone Birthday or Anniversary

With one of our major hospitals at crisis levels under your current approach @GladysB, it’s NOW time to call in Prof Thomas Borody to URGENTLY implement FRESH approach

There ARE alternatives & Prof Borody, a world class medical expert, has one ready to go

A way to set us free @GladysB

Uttar Pradesh government has claimed that it was 1st Indian state to have introduced large-scale “prophylactic & therapeutic” medical protocol leading to low cases & deaths

AND guess which drug featured in that protocol ...

As Leader of the United Australia Party I’ll be FIGHTING to have our FREEDOMS restored

WE want our FREEDOMS back NOW

UNITED we can get OUR Freedoms BACK

UNITED WE STAND

AND I need your support to send a strong message

Join in the FIGHT !!

👇👇👇

As Leader of the United Australia Party I’ll be fighting to BAN mandates & passports 

Your personal medical choices are PERSONAL

AND I’ll be fighting to keep them PRIVATE

AND not to be used to discriminate against you or to exclude you from society

Choice over Coercion ✔️ 
As Leader of the United Australia Party I’ll be fighting to end lockdowns & restrictions by taking an alternative approach to the current chaos & mayhem based on a FLAWED model of COERCION

INFORMED CONSENT based on alternatives NOT coercion

Real alternatives, Real choices ✔️ 
Around 50% of Israel’s 600 patients recently hospitalized with SERIOUS illness were FULLY💉

AND its Health Ministry raises new concerns that💉effectiveness against SERIOUS disease may be FALLING

💉NOT setting Israel free

TIME for PLAN B ...

ANTIVIRALS

Have Big Pharma Cultists lost the plot ?

US Senators get infected AFTER being FULLY💉& no one has a problem with that ?

If you can STILL get infected, hospitalised or sadly die AFTER being FULLY💉then shouldn’t EVERY Cultist be worried

CON JOB CONTINUES 
A Loyalty Program carefully tailored to Big Pharma Cultists getting💉after💉after💉

Room for EIGHT💉

Would be so exciting for Cultists

With a Fauci Plush Toy if they get the EIGHT

Why go for gold, when you can go for a Fauci plush toy ??

Then again, DON’T be fooled 
You’ve been WARNED that masks & restrictions MAY be required for YEARS

Did I miss something ??

Didn’t they tell us that💉 would set us free ??

AND another warning “God help us if we have another variant”

All because they DON’T want to look at ALTERNATIVES

CON JOB CONTINUES 
LIES & DECEPTION

BEWARE when they tell you 80%💉means ‘end’ of lockdowns & restrictions

Quebec ‘leaders’ used that line there to CON people & those same ‘leaders’ now keep RAISING % needed to ‘end’ restrictions

CON JOB CONTINUES

AND cases STILL SURGING 
During past week almost 30% of 439 patients hospitalized for infection in Massachusetts were FULLY💉

Cultists should just THINK about that

They’ve been promised they’ll be ‘protected’ from serious infection so what happens to those 30% of hospital cases

A very sad tragedy

Endless lockdowns are having a terrible impact on mental health in our community, especially among young people

Our heartless ‘supreme leaders’ are devastating our community and the lockdowns NEED TO END

We MUST stop the mental harm being caused by lockdowns 
INFORMED CONSENT remains a fundamental human right

Reports that CDC & FDA are looking at data suggesting higher risk of heart inflammation - also known as myocarditis and pericarditis - in young adults

CRIMINAL

To put fit & healthy young people AT RISK 

We keep hearing @GladysB saying there’s ‘no place on earth’ that has got on top of Delta

Well, Gladys is obviously NOT aware of outstanding success of Indian State of Uttar Pradesh & its CM @myogiadityanath in getting on top of Delta

Using, guess what...

FULLY💉Phillipines Police Officer sadly dies after getting infected

BUT explained away because of 'high comorbidity'

Wasn’t💉meant to ‘protect’ these vulnerable people ?

What happens when💉people are infected AND end up in hospital, ICU or worse ??

Cases keep SURGING in highly💉Israel

💉NOT setting Israel free

BUT Sheep & Cultists keep shutting their eyes & deluding themselves

Lockdowns & restrictions will remain DESPITE💉

💉people can STILL get infected & CAN pass it on

ANTIVIRALS NEEDED NOW

Time for LIBERTY over LOCKDOWNS

Let’s UNITE to end the lockdowns

We WANT our Liberty BACK !!

UNITED WE STAND

UNITED we can achieve so much

UNITED we can get OUR Liberty BACK

Join us in the FIGHT !!!

As leader of the United Australia Party I’ll continue the fight to BAN💉passports 

I DON’T want to see an Australia where we’re ordered by police & military to produce our ‘health papers’ just to cross a state border, to attend a footy match or go to pub or cafe

UNITED WE STAND 
As Leader of the United Australia Party I call on all Australians who’ve had enough of lockdowns & of the mismanagement of the major parties leading our nation into chaos & mayhem - to go to the United Australia Party’s website & JOIN US in this fight
👇👇

Under my leadership the United Australia Party will be a major force in politics

United Australia Party will run candidates in all 151 lower house seats across the nation & in all seats in the Senate
 
And we’ll be well resourced, VERY well resourced to protect our Constitution 
Under my leadership the United Australia Party will be fighting to end lockdowns & offer an alternate approach to the current mayhem & destruction that the Labor & Liberal parties have created
 
We’ll be putting Freedom over Fear, Liberty over Lockdowns & Choice over Compulsion 
With endless lockdowns, emergence of a police state, censorship & our state borders shut I no longer recognise the country I grew up in & I fear for our nation’s future
 
I have therefore decided to accept the offer to lead the United Australia Party to provide a true alternative

Europeans expect their citizens to get EIGHT (8) 💉

If it at first it doesn’t set you free, then try💉 after 💉 after 💉

You’d think they would realise 💉 is NOT going to set them free when it DOESN’T set them free

Just look at Israel...

They just DON’T get it

DISGUSTING 
DON’T BE FOOLED !!

A few months ago Quebec Govt promised its population that most restrictions would be LIFTED when 75% of population was fully💉

Threshold was met, but Quebec Govt said it would maintain current measures & add new ones

CON JOB CONTINUES

NSW Police ALSO out of control

DISGUSTING

‘Secret report’ claims Deputy Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon ‘shaped up’ to & swore at an ambulance officer trying to assist him after collapsing ‘intoxicated’

NSW Govt tried to cover up report

DISGRACEFUL

NSW is TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL

Cruelty to people AND now animals being SHOT DEAD

BEYOND WORDS

Several impounded dogs due to be rescued by a shelter have instead been shot dead by a rural council in NSW under its interpretation of ‘restrictions’

CRIMINAL

While you’re in endless lockdown & suffering financially NSW Police Commissioner is getting MASSIVE pay rise

DISGUSTING

MPs & senior public servants should be on $750 pw while their state or territory is in lockdown

We’re all in this together, aren’t we

What has become of OUR Country when a Police Officer POINTS A GUN at unarmed protesters ??

Wrong

UNACCEPTABLE

Police are OUT OF CONTROL

They are there to serve the people & NOT intimidate them with weapons pointed at their heads

Police acting UNLAWFULLY must be CHARGED 
It’s ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC to see the level of mental harm being caused across our country by the endless lockdowns

A big thank you to @LifelineAust & other support groups for being there for struggling Aussies during these challenging times

More FRONTLINE evidence for Ivermectin

CRIMINAL how cultists & sheep shut their eyes & mind

Crime against humanity to suppress a medical treatment that COULD save lives

Criminal negligence to allow infected people to suffer when a medical treatment COULD stop the suffering 
Now, that’s very interesting...

The Jerusalem Post is reporting positively on Ivermectin

Better late, than never !!

Maybe, just, maybe the Israeli’s are seeing through the con job

💉NOT setting Israel free
💉people are being hospitalised

NOTHING to lose with a FRESH APPROACH 
DISGUSTING

Big Pharma is ONLY about making lots of $$$

They push an EXPERIMENT onto us which is NOT setting us free but makes them lots of $$$

They SUPPRESS low cost ALTERNATIVES that would stop them getting final ‘approval’

FOLLOW the $$$

TRUTH will set you FREE 
Comrade Dan seeking to implement a perpetual state of lockdown

To divide us

To control us

To intimidate us

Much like George Orwell’s ‘1984’ where Big Brother implemented a perpetual state of war

As a means to divide, control & intimidate citizens

SHAME

TIME to RESIGN DAN 

🤡🤡 running the show are dividing OUR country & getting people to turn on each other

AND this is what happens-

ACT Police say their time is being wasted by "needless" calls like reporting 2 maskless children jumping on a trampoline in their own backyard

We have 🤡🤡 running the show when they STOP truckies having a proper meal & shower

These are long distance truckies who keep our country going & need a proper safety break

🤡🤡 stopping truckies from having proper meal & rest break need to be CHARGED with CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE 
Say NO to💉passports

If you haven't already done so.ontact your Federal MP asking them to support my Private Member's Bill to BAN💉passports

Say NO to💉COERCION
Say NO to💉DISCRIMINATION

Let's fight this together !!

Let's STOP the erosion of our personal freedoms 
REALITY CHECK for our Australian Democracy

Just a reminder for ...

BLM Protesters

Climate Alarmists

Student ‘climate strikers’

Big Pharma Cultists

AND all the nasty & hateful trolls generally

We’re a free country & we can agree to disagree

It’s our DEMOCRATIC right 
Dan has lost the plot

DAN MUST RESIGN

After seeing Police pointing guns at unarmed protesters, it’s definitely time for Dan to go

He’s trashing our Democracy

He’s destroying lives, jobs, businesses & the economy

DISGUSTING 
What has happened to OUR Australia ?

Freedoms & Liberties fought for by our ANZACs have been STOLEN by unelected medical bureaucrats who have established a Bio-medical Security State

Endorsed & supported by BOTH LABOR & LIBERAL party

DISGUSTING

We need a THIRD political force 
HYPOCRISY

Remembering when a protest was praised

Remembering when Police kneeled to protesters

As George Orwell said in ‘Animal Farm’ 

‘We are all equal, but some are more equal than others’

Just REMEMBER that Democracy Matters Too

You DON’T want Police guns pointed at you 
Police POINTING A GUN at unarmed protesters has NO PLACE in Australia

WRONG, WRONG, WRONG

UNAUSTRALIAN

EXCESSIVE FORCE

POLICE STATE

UNACCEPTABLE

SHAME on ‘our’ political leaders for DIVIDING our Country

DON’T trash our DEMOCRACY 
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING when a ‘Police Officer’ tries to INCITE the crowd to PROVOKE a response

That Officer NEEDS to be CHARGED immediately

WRONG for Police to PROVOKE & INCITE

WRONG for Police to try & escalate a tense situation

TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE in our DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY 
JUST RESIGN Gladys !!

You’re DIVIDING our society

Medical DISCRIMINATION is UNACCEPTABLE & WRONG

Your expression ‘Freedom plan’ is straight out of George Orwell’s ‘1984’

DICTATORS use that expression

We ALREADY have our FREEDOM

It’s called DEMOCRACY

And you’re thrashing it 
UTTERLY DISGUSTING

Police are OUT OF CONTROL

NSW Police Commissioner says he won’t hold Police accountable for WRONGLY issuing fines

Police putting people in chokeholds leading to them collapse

EXCESSIVE FORCE is ILLEGAL

WRONGLY issuing fines is ILLEGAL

STOP Police State 
AND time for so-called ‘Chief Medical Officers’ to also GO

FRESH APPROACH URGENTLY NEEDED

Mental HARM being caused by endless lockdowns is just UNSUSTAINABLE

Our society is being DESTROYED

Keeping people LOCKED UP destroys lives & livelihood 

DISGUSTING 
TIME TO GO Gladys !!

You’re DIVIDING our society

You’re DESTROYING our economy

You’re DEVASTATING our lives, livelihoods & mental health

RESIGN NOW !! 
Looking for a gift idea ?? 🎁 
They say there are no alternatives 

They LIE

Aussies who get infected & are at risk of being hospitalised will now have access to NEW drug to prevent  symptoms from worsening

Provisional approval given for use of antibody treatment drug Sotrovimab 
Time for PLAN B

Time for @GladysB to talk to Prof Thomas Borody

💉NOT setting Israel free

Breakthrough infections where FULLY💉are getting infected, being hospitalised & sadly dying means that 💉DIDN’T ‘protect’ those people

ANTIVIRALS NEEDED

In Los Angeles breakthrough infections are NOW 30% of ALL new cases AFTER Delta Surge

Fully 💉 people represented 5% of L.A.’s hospitalized infected patients in April, BUT by July, that number had RISEN to 13%

68 have sadly died

💉 NOT setting LA free

Reality check for💉Cultists

US Doctors warn💉doesn't make you ‘Superman’

You can STILL get infected AND pass it on after getting💉

‘Breakthrough’ infections are increasing with Delta

WRONG to think if you’re fully💉you’re ‘good to go’

DON’T be FOOLED


💉 NOT setting Israel free

Israeli “doctors are learning which 💉 patients are most vulnerable to severe illness, amid growing concerns about instances in which the shots provide less protection against the worst forms of the disease”

WAKE UP 💉 CULTISTS

Supreme leader Gladys acting like a DICTATOR AGAIN

DEMANDING Police Commissioner &  NSW CHO RETURN to podium to PROVE she’s telling the truth

Dictators are known to have ‘official’ entourage to reinforce their warped ‘sense of legitimacy’

RESIGN Gladys

Endless lockdowns causing MASSIVE mental health harm

UNCONSCIONABLE that ‘record-breaking high’ number of calls to Lifeline are occurring during these latest HARSH lockdowns

END THE LOCKDOWNS

AND SHAME on those SELFISH people wanting harsher lockdowns

SIMPLY HEARTLESS

A mother in northern NSW has been denied entry to Qld for vital tests on a cyst in her 4-month-old baby's brain after border restrictions tighten

UNCONSCIONABLE

Border restrictions are placing infant & children lives at risk

CRIMINAL

ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING

Trashing our Freedoms on the basis of ‘mixed’ evidence

Looks like the ‘Science’ approach is being SUSPENDED

Make it up as you go

Take away Freedoms

Get your Police to issue ‘fines’ even if they’re wrongly issued

Looking like a DICTATORSHIP everyday 
COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS we now ‘need’ a ‘permit’ to travel

Reminiscent of living in communist societies or trying to travel between East & West Berlin during Cold War

Hallmark of Authoritarian regimes trashing Democratic Freedoms

NSW Police Commissioner out of control for NOT holding Officers accountable for wrongly issued fines

NSW Police out of control with growing Police harassment because they’re not accountable for mistakes

WRONG !! 
Well done @TanyaDaviesMP for STANDING UP to your ‘colleagues’ who are pushing💉COERCION

DISGUSTING how NSW Liberal Party has LOST its way

DISGUSTING how your ‘colleagues’ attack you for standing up for INFORMED CONSENT & Pro-FREE CHOICE

STOP💉COERCION

NSW Police Commissioner OUT OF CONTROL by NOT holding Police to account for wrongly issuing fines

“if you write a ticket, and you get it wrong, I understand, and I won’t hold you to account for that”

DISGUSTING

Police MUST be ACCOUNTABLE in a DEMOCRACY

Comrade Dan commands that ...

Shame @GladysB Shame

You’re DESTROYING businesses !!

New businesses in NSW are ineligible to receive financial assistance if they don’t have any revenue history, leaving business owners DEVASTATED if they paid set-up costs but didn’t start trading

ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING @GladysB that there’s STILL upwards of 60,000 NSW businesses waiting to receive financial support

Businesses are massively struggling & many will go out of business because of your Govt’s STUFF UPS

UNACCEPTABLE

Gladys needs to GO

REOPEN breast screening clinics NOW @GladysB 

President of Clinical Oncology Society of Australia has become latest voice to join calls to reopen BreastScreen NSW service

Gladys putting lives at risk by delaying early detection of cancer

DISGUSTING

Delta regularly reminding us💉will NOT set us free

Just look at Israel

Highly💉

BUT serious cases SURGING & restrictions being extended

DON’T BE FOOLED

Restrictions will REMAIN regardless of level of💉

New approach REQUIRED to set us free

ANTIVIRALS

Spain’s Supreme Court declares💉passports ILLEGAL

Judges’ reasoning is basically that having to prove💉status breaches fundamental rights without having enough of a positive impact on public health

Makes perfect sense as💉people can still infect others

Blind faith & delusional behaviour of Big Pharma Cultists knows no limits

Disagree with them & you’re a conspiracy theorist

Argue with them & YOU’RE the one who’s dangerous

Persist in your argument & they tell you to die

BUT💉NOT setting Israel free & that should HAUNT THEM 
ANOTHER💉person sadly dies after getting infected

BUT no one seems concerned that 💉 didn’t ‘protect’ this person

No one asking WHY💉didn’t ‘protect’ this person

That’s the PROBLEM !!

No questioning when💉person ends up in hospital or worse

DISGUSTING

Israel, once offered up as THE ‘model’ for setting us free, is facing SURGE of infections

Israeli💉narrative now IMPLODING

One of the most💉countries, Israel now has one of the HIGHEST infection rates globally, raising serious QUESTIONS about💉efficacy

REALITY CHECK for Big Pharma Cultists

If Israel is anything to go by, lockdown WON’T be ending in NSW when the 80% level is reached

OTHERWISE cases & deaths will end up like Israel

💉NOT setting Israel free as cases are SURGING & restrictions being REINTRODUCED

OPEN YOUR MIND 
So a lot of pain for ‘a bit better’ life when you reach 80%

What about SURGING cases in HIGHLY💉Israel where restrictions are being EXTENDED

BEWARE of politicians who take away YOUR freedoms promising to give them back to you

Power corrupts & absolute power CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY 
In 7 US states the State Governor has already signed laws to BAN💉mandates

Never forget INFORMED CONSENT is a FUNDAMENTAL Human Right

FORCED medical treatments have NO place in a Democracy

STOP💉COERCION

Say NO to 💉passports

UNITED WE STAND !!

What has our Country become when they fence off play equipment ??

BEYOND DISGUSTING

Locking us up indefinitely, taking away OUR Freedoms, COERCING people to get💉or EXCLUDE them from society, fencing off play equipment

Their power grab is out of control & threatening DEMOCRACY 
TWO major parties are now just the SAME

Yes, let’s compare the pair

They’re BOTH taking away your Freedoms

They’re BOTH introducing a Police State

They’re BOTH morally bankrupt

They’re BOTH destroying the economy, jobs & mental health

SHAME

TIME for a NEW political force 
Promises, Promises

When you get to 80% we MAY, POSSIBLY, HOPE TO give YOUR freedoms back

AND it DEPENDS on what case numbers are doing 

Gladys is either stringing us along or she hasn’t been following the SURGING cases in HIGHLY💉Israel with new restrictions

CON JOB CONTINUES 
People Power works !!

Mayor listens to ‘calls from the community’ to BACKFLIP on Council’s RIDICULOUS decision to close playgrounds & outdoor gym equipment

The plot thickens...

New documents released to NSW Parliament raise fresh questions about Gladys’ role in facilitating a grant that Daryl stood to gain a political benefit from, at the same time she was secretly in a relationship with him

INTERESTING

Division in the Liberal ranks...

Finger pointing

Backstabbing

Covering backsides

Spiteful PM Office ‘background-briefing’ journos to undermine

Welcome to the nasty world of Slomo & Gladys, both facing elections & both being accused of being ‘too slow’

DISGRACEFUL NSW has ‘temporarily’ shut down its breast screening service

Sadly, cancer doesn’t ‘temporarily’ go away

Early cancer detection SAVES lives

REOPEN breast screening clinics NOW @GladysB 

You’re putting lives at RISK


How many infected people in NSW Hospitals have got💉@GladysB @NSWCHO

Tell us the truth !!

FULLY💉people are sadly dying overseas after getting infected AND real world ‘actual efficacy levels’ of💉 in Israel showing 💉 ‘protection’ falling against Delta

Massachusetts health officials report 2,672 new cases of infected people who had been FULLY💉with 496 hospitalized & sadly 18 deaths

Officials try to explain away FULLY💉people getting infected BUT💉was meant to ‘protect’ these people

ANTIVIRALS NEEDED

DON’T be Conned

Don’t be Fooled

💉will NOT set you free

💉passport will NOT set you free

They’ll promise you anything to get you to get💉

BUT restrictions will remain even when highly💉

Just look at Israel

Beware of political leaders making promises about your future 🤔 
Qld construction unions will fight laws making 💉 mandatory on building sites as that would remove rights of workers to make “Informed personal choices”

“Any employer found to be illegally coercing workers will be dealt with to the full extent of the law”

I stand with ALL those who-

&gt;want salaries of MPs & senior bureaucrats CUT to $750pw so that we can ALL really be in this together

&gt;want to fight for their FREEDOMS

&gt;want a Federal Anti-corruption Body

&gt;want superannuation that fits their needs free of unintended consequences 
New word describing a group of people who think they’re morally superior but are easily brainwashed & don’t think for themselves

They think they’re invincible because they get💉 & show off about it, but may STILL end up in hospital as seen in Israel & Iceland

They DON’T get it 
STOP💉COERCION

Personal medical choices are PERSONAL medical choices

Freedom of medical choice is underpinned by fundamental human right of INFORMED CONSENT

STOP the BLACKMAIL, EXTORTION & DISCRIMINATION

STOP threatening people’s livelihood

DISGUSTING

FULLY💉 90 yr old Singaporean man has sadly died after getting infected

Health bureaucrats quick to point out ‘underlying’ health issues

BUT they tell us💉is meant to ‘protect’ these vulnerable people

They’ll say anything

SHAME

BEWARE employers who COERCE or even ‘incentivise’ employees to get💉

You open yourselves up to compensation claims for any adverse reactions or worse

Legal actions or class actions AWAIT

STOP💉 COERCION

Informed Consent is a FUNDAMENTAL Human Right !!


CRIMINAL to deny a person a choice of medical treatments when alternatives are available

CRIME against humanity when they SUPPRESS alternative medical treatments

OBSESSION with suppressing Ivermectin denying medical choice AND costing lives

I stand with all those concerned that suspending these routine screenings could delay cancer diagnosis & lead to unnecessary deaths due to failure to detect cancer as early as possible

DON’T put lives at risk

How many infected people in NSW Hospitals have previously got💉 @GladysB @NSWCHO ??

With FULLY💉people sadly passing away overseas after getting infected, we must have FULL transparency about the number of💉people being admitted to hospital here

This is what a Police State looks like

Giving power-seeking Police Commissioner more & more power to COERCE & INTIMIDATE citizens has NO place in a DEMOCRACY

You’d see it in a tinpot dictatorship NOT in Australia

DISGUSTING

Gladys is out of control AND needs to go !! 

💉NOT setting Israel free DESPITE being highly💉

Cases SURGING & restrictions remain 

DON’T BE FOOLED

Gladys admits restrictions will remain even when NSW highly💉if cases remain high

Highly💉Israel seeing high case numbers due to Delta even in FULLY💉

As of 15 August, 514 Israelis hospitalized with severe or critical case, a 31% increase from just 4 days earlier

Of 514 ... 59% were FULLY💉

“There are so many breakthrough infections that they dominate & most of the hospitalized patients are actually💉” 
Greece sadly reports 1st death of FULLY💉infected person who did not have any underlying disease

ICU Doctor says “We should not see the inoculated as invincible, they should also be careful”

A few questions @GladysB 

Are you following Israeli experience where💉NOT setting Israel free

How many infected people in NSW hospitals, not just ICU, had got💉

How many adverse reactions have been recorded at💉hubs, especially amongst Yr 12 students

More blood clot ‘coincidences’

11 more reports of ‘rare’ blood clots disclosed by TGA which includes 5 that “may possibly be related to 2nd dose”

2 cases- 82 yr old West Australian & 22 yr old Victorian man- have been confirmed linked to first dose of💉

We need a FULL REPORT @GladysB @NSWCHO ASAP on ALL medical episodes at💉hub, especially those involving Year 12 students

That includes number & types of adverse reactions

Cases SURGING in ISRAEL

Israel has rushed/pushed💉

Israel BOASTED about its high💉rate

BUT now serious cases skyrocketing

Their response...

Booster💉 BUT serious cases KEEP climbing

Plan B NEEDED URGENTLY

Time to swallow pride

ANTIVIRALS NOW !!

Daily Telegraph reporting Gladys letting us know ‘restrictions as long as Delta around’

DON’T be FOOLED !!

Israel shows💉NOT setting us free 
The sad tragedy of significant mental health harm being caused to young people by endless lockdowns continues

Alarming rise in self harm being sadly recorded shows deepening youth mental health crisis that an expert has described as a “shadow pandemic”

AND now the serious adverse reactions are starting with Israel’s booster💉

A woman in her 50s was hospitalized in a serious condition after likely suffering an allergic reaction from a booster💉

They just WON’T learn !!

It’s ALL about making lots of $$

They’ll do anything to stop you getting access to Ivermectin

They’ll try to discredit a perfectly good drug

They’ll try to limit supply of a perfectly good drug

Why are they frightened of Ivermectin

Because it stops Big Pharma from making lots of $$ on💉

AND it’s that simple 
TRAGEDY to find symptomatic acute myocarditis in 7 healthy male adolescents after💉

At this stage, just ‘coincidence’ that ALL presented with chest pain within 4 days of getting 2nd dose

Putting healthy young men at such risk is a crime against humanity

Our great & benevolent supreme leader implementing her new economic program respectfully known as Gladynomics underpinned by-

&gt;‘crash or crash through’ or both approach
&gt;‘Screw your freedom’ philosophy
&gt;I have lots of hardware I can deploy, sorry, I mean Police Assets to deploy 
It was only a matter of time before Israel started talking about Plan B with growing realisation that being HIGHLY💉has NOT set them free

Experts now saying Israel’s recent surge CONFIRMS need for Multimodal Strategy

You guessed it ANTIVIRALS

FINALLY !!

Trial combining nitazoxanide, a well-known anti-parasitic drug that would be given for its potential antiviral effect & ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid with an anti-inflammatory effect

Both already available, affordable, safe & easy to administer ! 
WOW !

Big Media giving us ‘lessons’ on ‘stopping our family falling for conspiracy theories’

That’s the same Big Media feeding us THEIR propaganda

DISGUSTING how media tries to tell us what to think

It’s a FREE country & INDEPENDENT thinking is ALLOWED

More💉COERCION, More Blackmail & More Extortion

They WON’T let you travel, work or go out unless you get💉

BUT IT’S A CON

💉NOT setting Israel & Iceland free DESPITE being highly💉

AND US CDC has issued TRAVEL WARNINGS to those countries

PLAN B NEEDED

DISGUSTING that LOSS of FREEDOM 1st announced on Social Media

Just shows how close Big Tech & Big Govt are

DON’T ever forget that it’s about CONTROLLING you

They pretend to ‘care’ about you, BUT they just want you to do what they tell you

They’re 🤡🤡

All hail Gladys !!

Clear the streets as Gladys our great & benevolent supreme leader heads to her 11.00am date with your destiny

With the question on every voter’s mind...

Which Freedom(s) will we lose today ?? 
UK researchers have found that while ‘rare’, a blood clot syndrome after first dose of💉carries high risk of death AND can occur in otherwise young & healthy people

‘rare’ but if you get it you’re in serious trouble

So everything’s fine until it’s not 🤔


💉NOT setting Israel free as promised

Time for Plan B

After jump in severe cases since start of August to 400 with majority of patients FULLY💉

Something seriously WRONG when majority of NEW serious cases FULLY💉

Time for Big Pharma Cultists to WAKE UP

EUROPE’S drugs regulator is looking at 3 new possible side-effects related to💉

Erythema multiforme, a form of allergic skin reaction AND glomerulonephritis & nephrotic syndrome (disorders related to kidneys) are being studied

More ‘rare coincidences’ 🤔 
Study WARNS that teenage boys are 14 TIMES more likely to suffer ‘rare’ heart inflammation from💉

With doctors at Boston Children's Hospital WARNING that long-term risks of post💉myocarditis remain unknown

Putting healthy teenagers at risk is CRIMINAL !!

BLIND OBSESSION with💉has meant OTHER potentially life saving medical treatments have been IGNORED

Now with💉NOT setting us free as promised, it’s time to OPEN our MINDS to possible OTHER treatments

MesenCure ??

NOTHING TO LOSE in trying to SAVE LIVES

WOW

ANTIVIRALS getting more attention BECAUSE of Israel

MORE experts SAYING

“While many have focused on antivirals purely as a treatment, their real power is in their prophylactic use, preventing people from ever becoming ill or passing on an infection”

They say we ‘need’ to get💉 BUT💉NOT setting Iceland free as promised

A high💉rate has NOT been able to prevent Iceland from being in middle of a NEW wave of infections

TIME to look at OTHER treatments

STUBBORN refusal to do so COSTING LIVES

DISGUSTING

As countries STUBBORNLY continue to IGNORE that💉NOT setting Israel free as promised, SOME countries are OPEN MINDED & TRIALLING early treatments to SAVE LIVES

GREAT TO SEE availability of drugs to prevent mass hospitalisation is a PRIORITY in Africa


This is what world media thinks of Australia

We’re being COMPARED to NORTH KOREA

DISGUSTING that our ‘political leaders’ are DESTROYING our FREEDOMS & giving themselves MORE & MORE power to CONTROL & COERCE citizens

We must FIGHT this in Court, Parliament & at the BALLOT BOX 
Well said George !!

ANOTHER TRAGEDY

Study finds common themes among 60 pandemic-linked suicides were disturbance to people’s “sense of self”, their relationships with others & social connections

BIGGER TRAGEDY would be if number of linked suicides sadly surpassed 🦠 deaths

Very sad that concerns are growing for the mental health of our children as lockdowns continue indefinitely

ANOTHER tragic cost of lockdowns which may sadly be felt for years to come

Israeli💉BREAKTHROUGH cases now EXCEED 50%

When new SERIOUS cases involving FULLY💉people are MORE than those involving not💉people you have a BIG PROBLEM

Delta breaking through💉which means people can STILL get infected AND end up in a serious condition

So Israel now looking to Plan B

Makes perfect sense given💉NOT setting Israel free as promised 

DESPITE being highly💉Israel is seeing surge in infections with most NEW serious cases being FULLY💉

If ONLY countries could ESCAPE Big Pharma💉EVIL SPELL 🤔

And they want to💉teenagers

New study warns of ‘rare’ heart complication which is more prevalent in teenage boys

Problem with heart inflammation in teenagers is that it may stick with them for life

Why put healthy young people at risk

DISGUSTING

Ever wondered why💉not settling us free as promised AND struggling to do so with Delta

If FULLY💉people can be contagious with Delta, then lockdowns could last indefinitely, especially if💉“protection” starts to wane after about 6 mths

Explains Israel & Iceland

Plan B NOW 
Can a vitamin D deficiency be a problem ??

Apparently so 😉

Perhaps some healthcare attention on making sure population is NOT vitamin D deficient would be a good thing 😉

Perhaps KISS principle of KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID could be applied with ANTIVIRALS, Zinc & Vitamin D 😉 
Deadly Lambda variant could be neutralizing💉according to new study

New evidence showing the latest Lambda variant- ravaging parts of South America- won’t be slowed by💉

Now, that’s a surprise 😉

They said💉will set you free

But then came the variants


'Gladys looking down on us like the supreme leader’

Summaries reaction to Gladys appearing on giant TV screens to help indoctrinate kids at💉hub

Is Gladys auditioning for Big Brother role in PC remake of George Orwell’s masterpiece 1984

All hail Gladys

Amazing how efficient Big Govt is in finding new ways to TRACK its citizens

I wonder if any of these new tracking measures will ever be discontinued or will you ALWAYS be required to ‘check in’ when going shopping ??

If only Big Govt was that efficient in pursing IVERMECTIN 🤔 
More threats, more COERCION, more DISCRIMINATION & more UNCONSTITUTIONAL actions

💉 NOT setting ISRAEL & ICELAND free as promised & they keep pursuing Plan A

💉passports USELESS because FULLY💉can be INFECTIOUS

What happens to FULLY💉person in ICU ??

ANTIVIRALS PLAN B NEEDED

💉 ‘hub’ on alert after person tests positive

What a circus

They tell us not to gather but they have gatherings at💉 ‘hubs’

The sooner they look at ISRAEL & realise💉 will NOT set us free as promised AND pursue ANTIVIRALS, the sooner we will be set free

ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL

With Sydney’s lockdown stretching into 7th week, small businesses owners are ANGRY over Service NSW’s FAILURE to get relief payments flowing to businesses quickly

COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE

NSW Liberal Govt FAILING BADLY

DISGUSTING

How many infected people in NSW Hospitals had previously got💉 @GladysB @NSWCHO

We know that some in ICU had got 1x💉

We know one FULLY💉person has sadly passed away

We know MAJORITY of NEW serious cases in ISRAEL are FULLY💉

We need FULL TRANSPARENCY

Time for FRESH IDEAS @GladysB

Endless lockdowns, destroying jobs, businesses & NSW economy

UNSUSTAINABLE

Time to convene Taskforce of medical professionals with RANGE of professional opinions

AND include Prof Thomas Borody

NOTHING TO LOSE Gladys


💉NOT setting Israel free

Official Israeli figures show number of serious cases rose on Wed to 400, the highest figure since March

About 150 of these patients are not fully💉

So about 250 or MAJORITY of new SERIOUS cases were FULLY💉

ANTIVIRALS NEEDED

Let the LEGAL CHALLENGES to💉COERCION BEGIN !!

NSW Govt’s ‘direction’ for construction workers to get 💉 if they want to return to work faces a potential constitutional challenge

Let’s all get behind @GandBLawyers 

STOP💉 COERCION

UNITED WE STAND !!


Australian Constitution explicitly PROHIBITS any form of compulsion on citizens to take any form of medical or pharmaceutical service, including💉

UNCONSTITUTIONAL & UNAUSTRALIAN to COERCE citizens to get💉or EXCLUDE them from society

SAY NO to💉COERCION

STOP MISSING THE POINT

More Military, More Police, More OPPRESSIVE laws NOT the answer

Plan A NOT working as promised

Look at Israel & Iceland where cases surging & even FULLY💉getting infected

Time for PLAN B

Time to look at OTHER medical treatments

Nothing to lose !! 
Daily Telegraph sadly reports 1st fully 💉person has passed away in Sydney

Tragic reality is that this is happening around the world with growing number of breakthrough infections

FRESH ideas URGENTLY needed to help FULLY💉 & everyone else who gets infected

Time for ANTIVIRALS 
Pathology companies making lots of $$ from 🦠 tests WHILE ‘routine’ tests have ‘likely’ FALLEN

So as obsession continues, tests for OTHER DISEASES that sadly kill people BUT can be PREVENTED by early testing are NOT getting attention they NEED

DISGUSTING cost of lockdown

SHAME 
Official recognition that lockdowns are harming mental health in our community

BUT Gladys sticks with Plan A which is NOT setting us free as promised

They just need to follow Israel & Iceland experience where serious cases rising in FULLY 💉 people

Lockdowns causing considerable mental health harm AND massively disrupting education, businesses & economy

DISGUSTING that businesses have to CONTINUE to plead with NSW Govt to get MUCH NEEDED financial support flowing

DISGRACEFUL that almost HALF of all applicants have NOT received anything as Sydney lockdown continues indefinitely

Highly💉Iceland joins Israel on US CDC list for HIGHEST risk category for travel

CEC says international travel poses additional risks & even fully💉 travelers might be at increased risk for getting & possibly spreading some variants

💉NOT setting us free

Israeli infections skyrocketing with serious cases climbing dangerously

Israeli situation going out of control DESPITE high💉rate

They NEED a NEW APPROACH or we’ll be in lockdown INDEFINITELY

 Iceland’s Health bureaucrats say💉has NOT led to the herd immunity that experts had hoped for

They ALSO say that it’s become clear that💉people can EASILY contract the Delta variant as well as spread it to others

NOT SURPRISING💉narrative is IMPLODING

What the Big Pharma Cultists COERCING people into getting💉WON’T tell you

ANTIVIRALS are available AND critical to crushing any wave & any new variants

ANTIVIRALS work by blocking or slowing a virus’s ability to replicate inside a host

Nothing to lose !

SADLY not looking good in Israel

They RUSHED to💉everyone they can

Then Delta arrived & infections are surging & serious cases keep climbing & US warns against traveling there

Then they rush to 3rd💉& now some STILL getting infected after 3rd💉

TRAGEDY


💉COERCION is WRONG & DISCRIMINATORY

Forcing employees to get💉or lose their job goes against fundamental principle of INFORMED CONSENT

SHAME any employer who COERCES employees to get💉

Your COERCION will cost you lots of $$ in legal action & LOST SALES

DISGUSTING Big Tech CENSORS freedom of speech BUT turns a blind eye to nasty, hateful CYBERBULLIES

DISGRACEFUL that breast screening clinics have been shut in Greater Sydney during lockdowns

Community RIGHT to be ANGRY about OUTRAGEOUS closures

No end in sight to the lockdown

Keep pushing💉when Israeli experience showing that💉not setting Israel free

So it’s NOW definitely the time to talk about ANTIVIRALS like Ivermectin

More evidence @GladysB is destroying businesses across my Hughes electorate & NSW

DISGUSTING

Extended lockdown, extended delay in getting NSW Govt financial support

Some businesses will never reopen

Empty shopfronts destroy communities

DISGRACEFUL that people’s lives are being put at RISK because Health Bureaucrats are OBSESSED with just🦠

Sadly, MANY MORE people die from all those OTHER diseases that can be successfully treated after EARLY DETECTION

STOP putting lives at risk by ignoring those other diseases 

💉narrative IMPLODING in Israel 

US CDC advises Americans to STOP traveling to Israel after giving it its highest risk warning

AND warns that due to its high concentration of cases that even full💉people may be at risk of contracting & spreading variants

In a free country like Australia there’s NO place for💉COERCION

Our ANZACs made enormous sacrifices so that we could have our Freedoms AND not be oppressed or controlled by DICTATORS

Being FORCED to take a medical treatment is AGAINST our Aussie Freedoms

Parents being MISLED on MORE THAN just children’s snacks !!

Hey Gladys, have you spoken to Prof Thomas Borody ??

How many people are sadly going to die as we stop giving medical attention to all those OTHER diseases that kill hundreds or thousands+ of Aussies a year 
You’d expect NSW ICAC to thoroughly investigate latest allegations regarding Gladys & Daryl

But the ‘coincidences’ keep on coming

Israeli study reveals Pfizer may be linked to ‘rare’ eye inflammation cases

Of course “rare”

When does a growing series of “rare” events become “commonly” dangerous

DISGUSTING

You’d think with the devastation being caused to global economy by lockdowns & travel restrictions that EVERYTHING would be done to get back to normal

💉are OBVIOUSLY NOT setting the world free as promised

So it’s time to use the ANTIVIRALS already available

Nothing to LOSE !! 
Another reminder that evidence FOR Ivermectin keeps on growing

Keeping a scientific open mind will set you free from Big Pharma’s propaganda !!

Time to recognise that Ivermectin MIGHT have POSITIVE impact on health outcomes

Nothing to lose to use ANTIVIRALS

Ivermectin anyone 
Time for CLASS ACTIONS against employers who engage in💉BULLYING

COURT ACTION may cost Employer lots of $$$ for

&gt;ASSAULT
&gt;BATTERY
&gt;EXTORTION & BLACKMAIL in forcing employee to get💉or lose their job
&gt;BULLYING
&gt;UNFAIR DISMISSAL

STOP💉BULLYING

SHAME SPC

Research shows heart inflammation after getting💉could be more common than originally thought, but remains “minimal”

So “rare” becomes “minimal”

How do you explain that to person who gets heart problems

BUT RISK remains ⚠️

You dismiss it at YOUR RISK

Lest We Forget 🇦🇺 
DISGUSTING how a generation of young people is being harmed by heartless, endless lockdowns

SHAME on those who want to “Govern us harder” with harsher lockdowns

Mental health is SUFFERING & some may never fully recover

STOP the relentless SCAREMONGERING

LEGAL ACTION awaits BULLY Employers

Employer forcing employee to get💉could end up in court & cost Employer lots of $$$ for

&gt;ASSAULT
&gt;BATTERY
&gt;EXTORTION & BLACKMAIL in forcing employee to get💉or lose their job
&gt;BULLYING
&gt;UNFAIR DISMISSAL

STOP💉BULLYING

You know Big Pharma💉CON JOB starting to UNRAVEL when NEW medical treatments are being considered

But still DISGUSTING DOUBLE STANDARDS from a Govt that has FAILED to support a cheap & accessible treatment like Ivermectin yet will consider new treatments making Big Pharma big $$

SHAME @GladysB SHAME

For DESTROYING family businesses

Businesses across my Hughes electorate & the nation are struggling massively & many may NEVER recover

It’s HEARTLESS to ENDLESSLY continue the lockdown

AND you should know from Israeli experience 💉 will NOT set us free 
Evidence FOR Ivermectin keeps on growing

BUT the Big Pharma cultists STILL close they’re eyes

WHILE 💉 NOT setting Israel free with SURGING CASES

AND people still dying DESPITE getting 💉 or FROM getting 💉

CRIMINAL to DENY medical treatment

You’ve got blood on your hands !! 
DISGUSTING HYPOCRISY from Obama

REVEALED: Husband of Queensland Chief Health Officer’s ‘history’ with Big Pharma

Looks like he received travel perks & benefits when adviser to Pfizer

Well, well TRUTH always comes out

What other LINKS between Big Pharma & Big Govt who BULLY us to get💉

They say💉will set you free & allow you to travel freely

Well, that DIDN’T stop💉people getting INFECTED on a recent cruise

CON JOB continues

Creating FALSE sense of security

Ramping up💉BULLYING

Pushing USELESS💉passports

So Big Pharma can make $$$

French Unions STAND UP for their members

“We are not anti-vaxx but pro-free choice”

That’s ABSOLUTELY right for EVERYONE

PRO-FREE CHOICE for EACH & EVERY Union member

Let’s see if Aussie UNIONS stand up for ALL their members & fight for PRO-FREE CHOICE

This is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG @GladysB

DISGRACEFUL that a NSW Liberal Premier would try to CRUSH personal freedom of choice & TRASH fundamental human right of INFORMED CONSENT

What happened to Party of PRO-FREE CHOICE ??

DISGUSTING 💉 BULLYING & DISCRIMINATION

Time to RESIGN !! 
Say NO to 💉 MANDATES

Say NO to EMPLOYER BULLYING

Personal medical choices ARE PERSONAL

Workers SHOULDN’T be made to FEAR for their jobs

Workers should NOT be pressured into getting💉

INFORMED CONSENT is a fundamental HUMAN RIGHT

Say NO to💉 BULLYING

Health Canada adds Bell’s Palsy warning to Pfizer labels, but says💉still “safe”

Because, you guessed it, they say the Bell’s Palsy “rare”

If it’s “rare” then why the EXPRESS warning

So they can say we told you so if you SUFFER “rare” effect

DISGUSTING

We’re being reminded of the importance of maintaining our Vitamin D levels

Nothing to lose as 💉 NOT setting us free as promised

Just look at Israeli & Iceland experience with surging cases DESPITE high levels of 💉 
With ‘Friends’ like that, who needs enemies !!

DISGUSTING how all the SCAREMONGERING is dividing our society

Research shows children are far LESS at risk from being infected

Many children who are infected do NOT develop symptoms & those that do, tend to have a MILD illness

AND Big Pharma Cultists want children to get 💉

DISGRACEFUL

SHAME making $$ is priority


💉 NOT setting us free as promised

Nearly 400 people have been hospitalized & 100 have died in US State of Massachusetts due to breakthrough cases DESPITE being FULLY💉

Big Pharma Cultists push💉 when it may NOT stop hospitalisation or death

DISGUSTING

And they want children to get 💉

DISGUSTING

UNCONSCIONABLE

Big Pharma GREED has NO limits

Why put FIT & HEALTHY children & young people at RISK after research like this

👇👇👇 
Anyone wanting to “Govern us harder” by harsh lockdowns has no idea the substantial mental harm being done

With Research revealing high numbers of those surveyed in lockdown experiencing depression with others sadly contemplating worse

Lockdowns must END

You know Big Pharma Cultists have a BIG problem when even Big Pharma says

“The highly contagious delta variant will lead to an increase in breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated”

Can’t hide TRUTH forever !!

💉NOT setting us free as promised

Non-urgent elective surgeries are being postponed in Greater Sydney

We already have lockdowns causing substantial mental harm

Now people have to wait for non-urgent elective surgery further putting their lives & mental health at risk

How many infected cases in NSW hospitals (not just those in ICU) have previously got 💉 @GladysB @NSWCHO ??

STOP AVOIDING THE QUESTION

Fully💉people in US are being hospitalised & sadly dying, so we need to know how many are in that situation here !!

Are you following the Israeli experience @GladysB @NSWCHO ??

“A country of nine million people where most citizens over 16 are fully inoculated with the two-dose Pfizer”

&gt;Is seeing SURGING cases
&gt;Is REINTRODUCING restrictions

💉 NOT setting Israel free

DISGUSTING small businesses in my Hughes electorate & across Sydney are being massively stuffed around by the INCOMPETENCE of the NSW Liberal Govt

NSW Liberals FAILING to get all their financial help out to businesses

If the buck stops with you @GladysB then TIME TO RESIGN !! 
If brainwashed Big Pharma Cultists think💉will set them free, then they are NOT following Israeli AND Iceland’s experience

Both countries have rushed to💉 everyone they can BUT NOW BOTH have SURGING cases AND reimposing RESTRICTIONS

ANTIVIRALS needed NOW

Something TERRIBLY WRONG when 18 yr old rushed to emergency room AND told he was having a heart attack & suffering from myocarditis, or inflammation of heart muscle after 2nd Pfizer

DISGUSTING Big Pharma is pushing💉on FIT & HEALTHY young people

CRIMINAL

CDC confirms 699 Heart Inflammation cases after💉

Most cases reported after mRNA💉(Pfizer or Moderna) especially in male adolescents & young adults

Just ‘coincidences’ at this stage as ‘causal link not finally established’

Be warned ⚠️

#InformedConsent

And they’re pushing💉for young people

Korean health officials have reported death of a soldier in his 20s was due to myocarditis, or a type of heart inflammation, after getting Pfizer

Another tragedy & sad reminder

Your risk, your body, your choice

Follow the evidence, follow the Israeli experience AND the truth will set you free

High levels of💉 NOT setting Israel free

More cases

More booster💉

More restrictions 

More DELUSIONS 

Big Pharma Cultists want to believe in 💉 BUT Delta mocking them

Only a matter of time before ANTIVIRALS prove SUPERIOR

Zero is simply unattainable with Plan A & Big Pharma Con Job

Delta variant outsmarting Plan A

Lots of pain for little gain

Plan B needed NOW

Even Big Pharma searching for antivirals that make $$

ANOTHER unnecessary tragedy

"Sadly, a 34 yr old NSW woman died yesterday from confirmed TTS following a first dose of AstraZeneca” TGA says

DISGUSTING !!

Despite health bureaucrats globally NOT recommending it for under 60s PM & Premiers pushing it HARD

Hypocrisy of the LEFT has no limits 

They stop us seeing our families, having weddings or travelling AND Barack could even THINK of having a BIG PARTY as US cases surge

‘We’re all in it together’ EXCEPT when Left thinks rules shouldn’t apply to them

Evidence that heartless, endless lockdowns are DESTROYING jobs

ABS data shows Greater Sydney’s lockdown has punched a big hole in the city’s jobs market, with 5% of its workforce wiped from business payrolls

Gladys STOP destroying NSW jobs & economy !!

SHAME Gladys for all the SCAREMONGERING

BUT what about those other infected healthcare workers or people admitted to hospital 

STOP avoiding the question @GladysB  @NSWCHO

SHAME @GladysB SHAME

For making businesses wait SO LONG for NSW Govt financial support because of YOUR endless lockdown

Time for @ServiceNSW to get financial support out ASAP

Businesses are at breaking point

Mental health is at breaking point

NSW economy is at breaking point 
And they’re now wanting to💉kids

Big Pharma GREED has no limits

Money is the name of the game

AND Big Pharma money has NO conscience

They discredit cheap competitor antivirals that SAVE lives

They CON Big Govts & the gullible

AND avoid ALL liability

Highly💉 Israel seeing surge in cases & looking to introduce new restrictions

💉NOT setting Israel free

So now ‘booster’💉 being ‘rolled out’

Big Pharma & Big Govt’s ONLY answer is💉after 💉after 💉

BUT cases keep growing

DISGUSTING

ANTIVIRALS NEEDED

If you think💉 will allow you to freely & easily travel internationally just have a look at Israel

Where even international travellers who have got💉will need to quarantine

When will Big Pharma Cultists open their eyes & mind ??

ANTIVIRALS Plan B needed

For those wanting to ‘Govern us Harder’ with harder, longer lockdowns just KNOW that Suicidal & super-stressed kids are flooding hospital emergency wards with patient numbers surging 25%+

STOP endless scaremongering

STOP trying to control & intimidate

For Big Pharma Cultists who believe💉will set them free

Just follow Israeli experience & see how brainwashed you are

&gt;SURGING cases
&gt;FALLING💉efficacy
&gt;quarantine for international travellers REGARDLESS of whether they have got💉

Need ANTIVIRALS Plan B

Nice of Telstra to offer free payphone calls to support the community

Let’s see if other big corporates offer free products or donate some of their pay packets to support vulnerable people

AND let’s see if MPs & top public servants cut their pay to $750

STOP AVOIDING THE QUESTION

💉NOT setting us free


💉was meant to set us free

But 10 out of 53 in NSW ICU had got💉

Brainwashed Big Pharma trolls should be VERY WORRIED💉 may NOT keep them out of ICU

That’s the REAL PROBLEM 

Before trolls go into a frenzy it’s time for ANTIVIRALS

To PROTECT you once CON JOB is FULLY exposed 
They’ll say anything to get you to get💉

Then, they lock you up endlessly to scare you to get💉

Then, they say you’ll get your freedoms ‘back’ if you get💉

Then, they offer you money to bribe you to get💉

BUT💉 NOT setting Israel free

Antivirals WILL 

75% of NSW residents say public servants on $150,000+ should share pain with affected workers

I agree & will be moving Private Member’s Bill to CUT MP & senior bureaucrats salaries to $750 per week during lockdowns

So we can truly ALL be in this together

DISGUSTING 

NSW Police handing out more than twice as many 🦠 fines to western Sydney residents than to those living in city & eastern suburbs

STOP the DISCRIMINATION 

STOP ABUSE OF POWER

SHAME ‘Human Rights advocates’ for not calling out Police abuses

Another blow to restaurants struggling with endless lockdowns

Spare a thought for people, businesses & delivery drivers doing it tough because of heartless lockdowns

Maybe Army could help deliver meals & support vulnerable people RATHER being used to CONTROL & INTIMIDATE them ! 
More research in support of Ivermectin

Well, that's a surprise

Search for 'antivirals' is gaining momentum following Israeli💉experience

TRUTH will set us free



👇👇👇

How MANY infected people in our HOSPITALS have previously been FULLY💉 @GladysB @NSWCHO 

TELL US THE TRUTH NOW

If FULLY💉 health workers are getting infected & forcing other FULLY💉 to isolate, we need to know

Israeli data showing💉 NOT setting us free

Looking desperate & running out of ideas

Mistake after mistake

Constant scaremongering

Harming people’s mental health with endless lockdowns

Raw abuse of Police power

Ignoring Israeli 💉 experience

Destroying lives & NSW economy

SHAME Gladys SHAME

Time to resign !! 
So @GladysB @NSWCHO we know FULLY vaccinated health worker tested positive at Westmead

As a result we know 36 people must now self isolate for 14 days with 24 of them ICU nurses

BUT what we really need to know is if any of 36 people were FULLY vaccinated

11,025 FULLY💉people in NY state have tested positive after RISE in "breakthrough" infections with spread of Delta variant

AND still unclear how effective💉is against delta variant

AND💉people may be losing ‘immunity’ over time

💉NOT setting us free !!

FULLY vaccinated health worker tests positive sending dozens of intensive care nurses & medical staff at major Sydney Hospital into isolation

With 36 people now having to self isolate for 14 days with 24 of them ICU nurses

💉NOT setting these people free

You have to wonder when the advice of the ‘expert group’ ATAGI changes after Morrison publicly calls/begs/pushes/looks/asks/hopes for a change in that advice

Of course, ATAGI needs to be independent ... from a call from PM for a change in their advice to help PM move lots of💉 
Whatever you may think of Qld Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young’s view, it’s better to be right on your own, than wrong in a group

AND you have to worry when the ‘expert group’ ATAGI changes it’s view after PM publicly ’questions’ its previous view

Understanding ‘Battle of💉scientific reports’ would set brainwashed Big Pharma Cultists free BUT ONLY if they open their mind

&gt;Looks like💉’immunity’ begins to wane after about 6 mths
&gt;More Breakthrough infections in those aged 60+
&gt;PCR test settings IMPT

US CDC finds fully vaccinated people who get infected carry as much of virus in their nose as unvaccinated people AND could spread it to others

Makes vaccine passports TOTALLY USELESS as people having a passport could be infectious

BAN vaccine passports

Israeli cases surging & death toll rising again DESPITE high💉 rate AND now rush for 3rd💉

So-called ‘protection’ from💉fading after about 6 months

💉NOT setting Israel free as promised

Open your mind to Ivermectin

Expect more fake news, deception & misinformation from the taxpayer funded sycophants of Big Pharma at ‘their’ ABC tonight

Hey Gladys, how much did weekend Police ‘operation’ to stop non-existent protest cost TAXPAYERS ??

Tell the TRUTH

When people are struggling with your endless lockdown & destruction of THEIR lives & economy STOP wasting TAXPAYER money on ‘police actions’

Big Pharma narrative starting to fall apart in Israel

With yet another rise in number of serious cases DESPITE being one of the most💉 countries in the world 

AND as it starts 3rd💉

Big Pharma just wants to keep pushing💉

AND gullible follow like SHEEP

SHAME on Govts & Media for pushing endless lockdowns

You’ve no idea how many lives you’re destroying 

Time to FOCUS on sharp rise in those struggling with a mental health relapse

Time to FOCUS on alarming spike in those struggling with eating disorders

You CANNOT trust 2 major parties

They’ll say ANYTHING to CON YOU

BUT they ignore ISRAELI experience that DESPITE very high💉 their cases are SURGING with new RESTRICTIONS

💉 NOT setting Israel free

💉 NOT magic bullet

STOP creating FALSE of security

CON JOB continues !!

First, Big Pharma makes lots of $$ pushing 2x💉 then 3x💉

Then, they can’t hide 💉 NOT setting people free

Then, they start pushing ‘anti-viral’ to make more $$

AND gullible Big Pharma Cultists just follow like sheep

Ivermectin ??

So sad

A tragic unnecessary loss

Endless lockdowns are causing mental health harm to countless people in our community

Govts have blood on their hands for destroying people’s lives

The endless SCAREMONGERING just to push 💉 is HEARTLESS

DISGUSTING

Obviously, French know a thing or two about Liberty & Freedom from Tyranny

DISGUSTING how PM & National Cabinet has ABANDONED Aussies stranded overseas

With more than 38,000 Australians stranded overseas registered to return, it's TIME to bring them home

Meanwhile in Comrade Dan's Victoria

Police say last year's BLM protests were 'different' because of legal technicality  

HYPOCRISY ??

Well now they're called 'stay at home' orders

So NO student strikes, BLM & Climate Protests while orders in place !!

More abuse of power by NSW Police 

49-year-old man charged with criminal offences relating to 'online incitement of protest'

Human rights advocates, student strikers, BLM & Climate Activists

DON’T keep people locked up 

DON’T destroy businesses & economy

DON’T ignore Ivermectin 


(Part 4 of 4)

The fightback is about to start. The cavalry is mustering. Stay tune. 

The sons & daughters of the Anzacs, and those whose parents fled despotic & totalitarian regimes for the freedoms of our great southern land - ain’t going to put up with this any longer.

I received this email this morning. I think it sums up the feelings of millions of Australians. 

(Part 1 of 4) 
SHAME MORRISON SHAME

DIVIDING our nation with your bullying marketing tactics to force people to get 💉

DISCRIMINATING against those exercising their medical freedom of choice over their bodies

NOT respecting the freedoms our Diggers fought so hard for

WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED

Morrison, on behalf of the National Cabinet, has just announced those who exercise their free choice not to be injected with an experimental 💉 will be punished & have their freedoms restricted

This VIOLATES our Constitutional freedoms

WE MUST FIGHT THIS 
For the nasty, hateful ABC-loving trolls, it's time for ABC to STOP wasting taxpayer money on legal fees to defend the ABC's OUTRAGEOUS character assassinations

Looks like💉 ‘effectiveness’ may be as low as 39% in Israel with delta variant

💉 not setting Israel free

If brainwashed Big Pharma Cultists were ‘following the science’ they would be looking at Israel

So Gladys are YOU following Israeli experience ??
 
 The thing with delusional people who have put all their faith in 💉 is that they cannot see the mental trap they have fallen into

They’re so invested in 💉 & so keen to join the lynch mob they’re blinded to the risks, limits & dangers

Just look @ Israel 

DISGRACEFUL that looks like Sydney doctors’ clinic charging patients up to $250 for a consultation to get Pfizer

SHAME on profiteering Big Pharma & medical clinics !!

What do you expect @GregHuntMP when all of you are SCAREMONGERING so much ??

SHAME on those who peddle FEAR !! 
Big Pharma narrative unraveling big time in Israel

💉 NOT setting Israel free

Only the truth will set us free

&gt;Fading 💉 ‘protection’
&gt;need for ‘booster’
&gt;surging infections

Big Pharma Cultists worshipping false god

Open your eyes

Ivermectin awaits

All the nasty, hateful & brainwashed Big Pharma Cultists should check out Israeli 💉 experiment

You can keep deluding yourselves if you like, but at least follow what’s going on in Israel

Open your eyes before you fall of the cliff with all the sheep

You have to wonder how many NSW Liberal MPs & Councillors knew or suspected what was going on with Dodgy Daryl ??

Or wonder how many NSW Liberal MPs & Councillors have Chinese connections ??

How high did alleged corruption go ??

Time for a Federal ICAC

So Dodgy Daryl back in the news

Given Gladys is URGING us to call Crime Stoppers to dob in unmasked people, you have to wonder if anyone called Crime Stoppers to dob in Dodgy Daryl

NSW Police chasing unmasked bandits while alleged CORRUPTION flourishes

So NSW Police Commissioner asks asks his mate the PM for military intervention

Shouldn’t that be Gladys’ or even the NSW Governor’s call ?

Who’s calling the shots in NSW ?

NSW Police Commissioner with the help of a friendly PM ?

Say NO to MARTIAL LAW 
KEEP saying NO to💉 passports !!

Please keep contacting your own Federal MP to support my Private Member’s Bill to BAN💉passports 

💉 passports = DISCRIMINATION

💉 passports are USELESS because of “breakthrough” infections where FULLY💉 can still get infected 

UNITED WE STAND 
Completely OUTRAGEOUS to call in Military

We’ve were told by NSW Police Commissioner that NSW Police Force was able to ‘handle the situation’

Then he asks for new powers saying he needs MORE POWERS

Then he calls in the Military

Police State is FAST becoming Martial Law

SHAME 
What DISGUSTING scaremongering

What about FAILURE of leadership by Gladys & Brad Hazzard as REAL REASON for the endless lockdown

What about INFORMING multicultural communities about the RISK of Big Pharma’s Big Experiment ??

INFORMED CONSENT is not about following like sheep 
More evidence of the Federal Govt taking more & more control of our lives

Next step is to make it a mandatory National Digital ID Card

Which will be used to exclude you from society if you don’t comply

DISGUSTING

We must FIGHT AGAINST erosion of our Freedoms 

UNITED WE STAND 
More disruption to my Hughes constituents & people across ‘greater Sydney’ from the endless lockdown

DISGUSTING

The NSW Liberal Govt is destroying our lives & economy

Another blow for especially young people trying to get their license to get on with their lives

SHAME

Gladys, Brad Hazzard & ALL Shire Liberals should be ASHAMED of themselves for FAILING my Hughes constituents & anyone else using Sutherland Hospital in the endless delays with getting a MRI

Too little, too late !!

SHAME @GladysB SHAME

You’re destroying small businesses & NSW economy !!

👇👇👇 
CON JOB continues !!

FULLY💉 staff member working @ major Sydney hospital gets infected & is ‘potentially’ INFECTIOUS

Let that SINK IN for all those brainwashed Big Pharma cultists

Trying to force everyone to get 💉 BUT you can still get infected & be INFECTIOUS

Ivermectin ?? 
Next thing they’ll do is issue a public health order to outlaw cash 🤔

Big Brother just loves controlling YOUR life

&gt;Digital money
&gt;Digital ID
&gt;Digital Vaccine Passport

Welcome to the new world of Digital Authoritarianism

Where you’re just a unique number, NOT a unique person 

💉 NOT setting people free !!

As of July 12 US reported 5,492 breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people leading to severe disease

Of that number 1,063 fully 💉 people sadly died

BUT these figures most likely underreported

CON JOB continues !!

CUT MPs PAY

If we’re all in it together, then ALL MPs & Senior Health Bureaucrats must take pay CUT to $750 per week while their State or Territory is in lockdown

Let’s all share the financial pain TOGETHER

How about it @GladysB @BradHazzard @Dom_Perrottet @JohnBarilaroMP ?? 
And to my great & loyal supporters, a BIG THANK YOU

I wish you a long life so you’re forever haunted by how your blind faith in Big Pharma’s experiment has destroyed people’s lives

You have blood on your hands !! 
Today 🇦🇺 has around 11.5%  💉💉x 2

On 12 April 🇬🇧 had around 11.5% 💉💉x 2 

But since then new daily 🦠 in 🇬🇧 increased from 23/million to 699/million.

The belief that rolling out the 💉 to catch up to 🇬🇧 is the path to ‘covid zero’ is the greatest mass delusion in our history 

@pbcooley Ivermectin, Zinc, Vitamin D, Doxycycline, HCQ, Fluvoxamine, Quercetin, 
Proxalutamide, Iota-carrageen, Curcumin, Povidone-Iodine and a big dose of TRUTH. 


Listen to the Doctor. 

That’s Dr. Jacy Andrade - not Dr Ally or Dr Tanya 


Listen to the Doctor 

Dr. Claire Saba, not DrAlly or Dr Tanya. 


@simon_ree In the same period in Israel, 10 🦠 deaths. 

8 in the 💉💉
2 in the unjabbed. 

Again, what’s the point ?
Close. He should have said “..... continue to sell EXPERIMENTAL medications .....’’ 
VAX PASSPORTS NEEDED TO ENTER MCG 

But what’s the point ? 

The latest data out of Israel demonstrates the inconvenient truth that it makes virtually no difference as to whether you had 2x💉💉 or none as to being infected.

Either you’re a mental case or you want to sell 💉 
In our eyes, ivermectin could be what ends the pandemic.

Dr. Magnus Burling , specialist general medicine
Dr. Hans Zingmark , specialist internal & pulmonary medicine
Dr. Sture Blomberg , specialist anaesthesia & intensive care, associate professor


With the latest data out of Israel it should be game over for the 💉💉 sellers and the moronic stupidity of those pushing Vaccine Passports. 

I wonder if anyone in the Australian media will report these figures ? 
BOMBSHELL - Latest data from Israel exposes Pfizer farce

NEW CASES 11 - 17 July 
Total new cases* for ages 20+ : 2,996
Fully 💉💉 : 2,523 (84.2%)
Un-injected : 473 (15.8) 

🦠 DEATHS : 10 
Fully 💉💉 8 (80%
Un-injected : 2 (20%)

*Additional small number of cases in those 💉x 1 
Professor Peter McCullough : ‘’Shut down this ill-fated program’’ 

Instead we have the incompetent Gladys & Chant daily 🤡 show. 

Sack them both and put Professor McCullough in charge, to end the lockdowns and start treating people early. 


CON JOB CONTINUES

Israel reports sharp decline in Pfizer efficacy

With Data from analysis conducted by Health Ministry suggesting efficacy of 💉 declines over time in preventing infection & severe illness

Experiment continues with💉 NOT setting us free

KEEP SAYING NO to 💉 BULLYING !!

TIME RUNNING OUT !!

So you set up ‘expert body’ called ATAGI

It’s your ‘go to’ body to back up your political decisions with ‘expert’ advice to put your political decisions beyond challenge

BUT what happens when they give you advice you don’t like ?

Then you constantly ask them to change it !! 🤔 
Albo gets to TRAVEL around the country side while his constituents in Sydney are locked up

DISGUSTING

Albo “just doing his job” his mates say BUT workers who need to do their jobs & pay their bills are LOCKED UP in Sydney & around the country side

SHAME

So who’s running the show ??

@ScottMorrisonMP says he’s not to blame for current SHAMBLES

Doesn’t the buck stop with PM ??

Or are State Premiers to blame ??

@AnnastaciaMP in Tokyo

@GladysB making policy on the run

Lockdown @DanielAndrewsMP is back !!

Latest Data from 




shows as at 18 July 46.3% of survey participants reported adverse ‘event’ after 💉

“Safe & effective” ??

Any other business making that claim & then having 46.3% of customers complaining about product would be shut down or go bust 🤔 
Be warned ⚠️

61 yr old UK man left paralysed & unable to close his eye after both Pfizer doses in ...

You guessed it ... “rare side-effect”

It can be treated & most people make a full recovery in NINE months

But can take longer or be permanent says NHS

So typical of selfish & self centred elites who waste money on showing off

BUT want to control our lives with

&gt;experimental💉
&gt;vaccine passports
&gt;censorship
&gt;lockdowns

While hardworking businesses, workers, tradies & families struggle to survive endless lockdowns

Time to go @GladysB 

Not consulting frontline community leaders

DESTROYING businesses across Sydney

Stopping construction with no health advice to do so & with no warning

Putting workers out of work

Making policy on the run & then having to backflip

Don’t experiment on children & young people @GladysB @NSWCHO

UK will NOT 💉 children & teenagers until more safety data on 💉 becomes available

Expert Panel says benefits DON’T outweigh risks for most young people, who typically suffer only mild symptoms

How many NSW infected cases had previously been vaccinated @NSWCHO

Stop avoiding the question !!

Public Health England Report found 1 in 5 people who were fully vaccinated are "still vulnerable to getting infected with Delta variant & showing symptoms" 
TIME to RESIGN @GladysB

You’ve lost the community’s confidence

You’re acting like a dictator 

Your decision to shut down construction was atrocious

No industry construction, No health advice to do so, your Cabinet colleagues opposed to your decision

Wagga Wagga GP confirms AstraZeneca being thrown out because of ‘lack of patients’ 🤔

Perhaps people are just rightly making their OWN informed decisions about THEIR bodies

It’s their risk, their body, THEIR CHOICE !!

💉 bullies must STOP BULLYING !!

80 yr old WA woman is recovering from blood disorder that is a potentially deadly BUT

You guessed it ... “highly rare” side effect of AstraZeneca

With bleeding on the brain & platelet count of zero, meaning her blood wouldn’t clot

TERRIBLE

Be warned ⚠️

Censor the dissenting opinion ? 

What could possibly go wrong if we all followed the consensus? 
Can anyone explain Bhutan ?

With a population of 800,000 they managed to control an outbreak, then they had a mass 💉 program and when 60% were 💉 cases took off. 

This is not what the glossy colour brochure promised. 
If the Liberal Party want to save themselves, they need to urgently remove Gladys and Chant from all positions of power. 
Completely incompetent. 

What’s the difference between now & the end of July ?

They are just making it up as they go, causing untold pain, suffering & hardship. 
iL-Liberal govts in🇦🇺are abandoning Liberal Party principles, abusing humanrights forcing mandatory💉in section after section of🇦🇺society - in China, communist party officials are doing the opposite

🍀Ivermectin, the key to reducing infections & opening up society. 

Busted. 

Big Tech busted manipulating search results to hide information about Ivermectin.

What type of evil would apply special algorithms to hide information about a life-saving medicine ? 
Ms Berejiklian: ‘’stay at home’’

‘’Because we’re all in this together 🎶’’ 
It’s necessary to go for 100%, that way there’s no control group going forward to measure against, and then the crime of the century, becomes the perfect crime. 
To mass inject 12 year-olds , whom would be expected to have 7 decades or more of life ahead, with an experimental agent which has ZERO long term safety (as an excuse to lift lockdowns) would be one of the worst crimes against humanity ever recorded. 


To inject children, with an experimental agent that we know will cause many of them harm, not for the children’s sake, but to benefit the adults, is the exact opposite of what humanity should stand for. 

Anyone that even suggests such an idea should be removed immediately. 
LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE 

What type of evil unhinged women would even consider a plan to hold people hostages, deny them their freedoms & right to earn a living, until they hand over their children for mass injection with an experimental agent, which has no long term safety data ? 

‘NOT FREE UNTIL KIDS GET THE JAB’

Gladys & Chant must be sacked, this is a grotesque. 

What type of regime uses kids as human shields, injecting them with a experimental agent, putting them at risk to protect the adults ? 

If the Liberal Party allows this, they are finished.

STOP avoiding question AND implications that you can still get infected & be infectious after 💉

Latest Qld case was FULLY VACCINATED

Israeli evidence showing Delta variant “breaking through “💉 
What about NSW local council elections @GladysB ?

If you keep us LOCKED UP indefinitely, then you’ll have to POSTPONE Local Council elections scheduled for Sat 4 Sept

Don’t leave it to the last minute or you’ll have CHAOS like you’ve caused with lockdown

TELL US THE TRUTH @GladysB 

How long are YOU proposing to keep us LOCKED UP ??

Give a STRAIGHT answer & not the usual non-answer at your daily media show

You’re DESTROYING businesses

You’re DESTROYING jobs

END THE LOCKDOWN !!


ANOTHER debacle @GladysB 

Cutting public transport AND leaving essential workers STRANDED

You get paid your large salary regardless of your failures, while the voters are paying for your failures

Losing their livelihoods AND now they CAN’T get to work


There are lots of reasons why @GladysB MUST RESIGN, but final straw is HER DISGRACEFUL decision to PAUSE all CONSTRUCTION

This MASSIVELY DISRUPTS 

&gt; KEY sector of NSW economy
&gt; hardworking TRADIES
&gt; ALL businesses servicing construction sector

SO WRONG TO DESTROY BUSINESSES 
What a surprise

Israeli researchers say 💉 may be losing its efficacy in older people

With reports that about 90% of new confirmed cases in over-fifties group were people who had been fully vaccinated

Big Pharma Cult pushes 💉

BUT💉 not setting us free

THIS IS NOT WHAT THE BROCHURE PROMISED  

🇮🇱ISRAEL, July 4 - July 10

1,736 new 🦠 cases in ages 20+

85%  of new cases of people ‘’fully 💉💉vaccinated’’

Could the Israeli’s apply for a refund from the💉 sellers ? 

If any other product failed like this, you’d want a refund💰 
I wonder what early treatment she was offered by our government health bureaucrats after testing positive ? 




Ivermectin, Zinc, Vitamin D, Doxycycline? 



Or was she given nothing & left to listen to the fear mongering media ?
And just think, that the ABC through their MediaWatch program, have created the exact opposite impression in the minds of the Australian public.
Peter McCullough MD, MPH, FACC :

‘’The delta variant is the mildest one we’ve seen ...it has a very low mortality’’

Dr. Harvey Risch, Professor of Epidemiology, Yale  School of Public Health: 

‘’As Dr. McCullough said, this is very mild variant’’


That sums up the ABC’s MediaWatch 
And notice how the ABC blur the numbers show no one can see them. That’s because the calculations are correct - but that spoils their story. 
And a reminder how 💉 helps 🤔
But you’ll never see these facts on the ABC 
More shocking misinformation & smear from the ABC.

It is a fact that Deltas not ‘AS’ dangerous (as it has a significantly lower case fatality rate - which is the important point I made) 

But note how the ABC conveniently leave out the word ‘AS’ - to mislead smear & defame. 
Just keep repeating ‘safe & effective’ and listening to the ABC and everything will be fine. 




The effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Delta variant is “weaker” than health officials had hoped, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on friday

“We do not know exactly to what degree the vaccine helps, but it is significantly less,”
Yet we still have clueless government health bureaucrats &useless politicians ignoring the science and forcing 😷 upon Australians.

It’s never been about our health, or the evidence - at every turn, it’s been all about spreading fear to sell the 💉 


Time for @GladysB to RESIGN

@NSWCHO says she did NOT advise Govt to shut down construction sector insisting decisions on restrictions & lockdowns are matters for ministers

DISGUSTING to punish the hardworking Tradies, construction sector & ALL BUSINESSES

END CONSTRUCTION PAUSE NOW

STOP DESTROYING BUSINESSES

START UNLOCKING SYDNEY NOW !!

Endless lockdowns are UNSUSTAINABLE & are DEVASTATING NSW economy

@GladysB, other MPs & bureaucrats all get to keep their BIG salaries

While ordinary Aussies SUFFER !!

What DISGUSTING HYPOCRISY & DOUBLE STANDARDS

My Hughes constituents & other hardworking Aussies CAN’T leave for funerals, business dealings or reunite with family & loved ones

They are ignoring the science & the evidence and leading the state to a disaster.

END CONSTRUCTION PAUSE
@GladysB 

Your ‘Pause’ across ALL of Sydney will MASSIVELY HURT construction livelihoods

It will cost millions per week as already struggling workers across Sydney will be out of work for UNKNOWN period

STOP DESTROYING BUSINESSES

People can get a QUICK result at home with Rapid Testing 

AND takes pressure off testing labs that are obviously struggling with flood of testing following FORCING people with ‘surveillance testing’ to line up at testing centres

💉 was going to set us free they said

BUT UK infections are SKYROCKETING !!

Hospitalisations AND deaths are INCREASING

NOT GOOD for UK & Big Pharma narrative

BUT Big Pharma disciples & apologists STILL DELUSIONAL !!

At last count (and likely to be significantly under-reported) 3,788 people in the USA that were injected twice still caught Covid & needed hospitalisation and 691 them died.

It’s a reminder that even the twice 💉💉still need 🍀Ivermectin 


Dr Tess Lawrie on 🍀Ivermectin : 

‘’I have never seen such a large body of evidence ignored ...... I’d give it to my children’’


Brett Weinstein & Dr Tess Lawrie, two champions fighting for truth on 🍀Ivermectin against the insidious disinformation campaign being waged by the Vaccinists of Big Pharma & their useful idiot supporters. 

A must listen : 


If Morrison/Dan Andrews/ Gladys/ Palazcuk attempt similar in Australia, I believe we will see the largest protests in our nation’s history. 
And a society that at the same time cheers on those that seek to censor free speech and squash dissenting opinions has completely lost its way. 

Perhaps we deserve what might be coming. 
Why is it, that the countries in Europe with the highest rates of mass 💉💉 are also the nations where the  new 🦠🦠 cases are the highest ? 

Perhaps the great consumer scam in history is unraveling? 

And we still have people in 🇦🇺 fooled to believe that mass 💉 will reduce 🦠 
Moronic ill-informed comments by the big bankers. 

As we’ve seen from the UK, The Netherlands and elsewhere, mass 💉💉 correlates with higher rates of 🦠🦠


Why stop at Facebook ? 

How long along until GOVERNMENT monitors telephone conversations to weed out people spreading ‘misinformation’ contrary to govt approved views - & bans people from using the telephone network ? 

These people have no clue of the dangerous path this is. 
BEACH CRACKDOWN ? 

Just more proof that Gladys & her incompetent band of 🤡health bureaucrats don’t have clue.

They don’t follow evidence & they don’t have any idea of the immense damage they doing.

It’s not about health, it’s about power & control.


Beach Crackdown ? 

Can any of the bumbling incompetents from NSW Health running this 🤡show, show ANY data about covid infections on beaches from anywhere in world to justify such a ‘crackdown’ ? 


Incredible

Even the most skeptical of the promises made by the 💉 sellers could not have predicted the explosion in new cases in the UK after 50% of the adult population was injected x 2

Only the most ill-informed could continue to fall for the con that mass 💉 is the path out 
More SCAREMONGERING !!

They lecture us on the ‘need’ to 💉 everyone, BUT they DON’T talk about the INCREASING cases in countries that have pushed 💉

They DON’T talk about Israeli experience where 💉 LESS effective against Delta variant

Big Pharma Cult have been BRAINWASHED !! 
You know Democracy is under THREAT when the GOVERNMENT itself CONSPIRES with or DIRECTS FACEBOOK to CENSOR your content

Surely this wouldn’t happen in Australia ??

OR would a Govt be TEMPTED to ask Facebook to shut down or CENSOR Facebook content because Govt didn’t like it ?? 
Despite being FULLY vaccinated 656 Alaskans still tested positive over 5 month period

“Breakthrough” infections make vaccine passports DANGEROUSLY MISLEADING as people with a passport could be infectious if allowed into places

Say NO to vaccine passports

TIME for WIDESPREAD use of RAPID TESTS @GladysB @NSWCHO 

STOP wasting HEALTHY people’s time in endless LONG testing queues

RAPID TESTS at HOME may be helpful in detecting high viral loads AND could be effective if used regularly 

HOME RAPID TESTING NOW


“Safe & effective” they say

AND they ignore the VAERS data

All those MISCARRIAGES, MENSTRUAL DISORDERS & HAEMORRHAGES they say are just “coincidences”

Big Pharma Cult has made them DELUSIONAL ZEALOTS

Time to say NO to Big Pharma LIES & DECEPTION !! 
What a DISGRACE @GladysB @NSWCHO

Your endless lockdown is having a DEVASTATING impact on those LIVING ALONE

You’re DESTROYING businesses, the economy AND people’s mental health

Your pursuit of zero cases where that is being abandoned overseas has to END

SHAME @GladysB SHAME

As WAIT TIMES for test results BLOW OUT more & more people’s lives are being MASSIVELY DISRUPTED

TIME for RAPID TESTING which can be done at HOME

RAPID TESTING SAVES so much time & reduces stress & anxiety

Yet another study finds Fauci’s beloved & expensive Remdesivir useless.

It’s Malfeasance at its highest. A special place in hell awaits them. 
And just think - all those costs, all those adverse events (Myocarditis, clots & deaths) and a population now seeded with an experimental agent for which we have NO IDEA of the long term adverse health consequences - and all for this 👇🏼

TIME to POSTPONE NSW Local Council elections on Sat 4 Sept @GladysB

You say you’re worried about spreading infections across NSW to justify DESTROYING economy, small businesses & communities

Then you can’t have people spreading infections on Election Day

What a DISGRACE @GladysB @NSWCHO

After causing lots of UNNECESSARY stress & anxiety the list of EXEMPT WORKERS ‘allowed’ to leave South West Sydney has EXPANDED

STOP making policy on the run

STOP PANICKING

STOP SCAREMONGERING

STOP TRASHING OUR RIGHTS

TELL US THE TRUTH @GladysB @NSWCHO

How many infected people in NSW hospitals have previously been FULLY vaccinated ?

You keep avoiding the question BUT it’s now time for FULL TRANSPARENCY

As Delta variant is breaking through 💉 we need to know the TRUTH

How much more evidence and how many more red flags do we need to see before wake to the fact that policies of Lockdown, mask, inject & inject again (while denying Ivermectin) are insane. 
Luckily, they all had their Vaccine Passports !




The 3,700 crew members had all received both Covid-19 vaccinations, said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. 
The greatest consumer scam in history. 
Proxalutamide. Just watch the Vaxinists do everything to destroy it. 


This sums up the insanity of the policy of lockdown, mask, inject & inject again. 
Fascism in action. 

This is so distressing to see. 😓

The USA, a nation that throughout its history sacrificed so much blood & treasure to protect free speech & the right to hold dissenting opinions, now wants people censored on one site, blacklisted & censored on other sites. 
With 87.8% of the adult population💉the UK has just posted 54,674 daily new cases & 300,302 in past 7 days

The Morrison/Andrews/Gladys policy of copying the UK’s policies of lockdown, mask & inject (while ignoring Ivermectin) is a descent into madness. 


Will The Guardian Australia correct their misrepresentation of the science ?

Or with The Guardian having pocketed millions in cash from Gates are they totally compromised ? 

A sad day for journalism in Australia. 


The Guardian accused of misrepresenting the science. 

Shame The Guardian, Shame. You’ve betrayed your readers. 
Wow, I could never understand why the India State of Tamil Nadu blocked Ivermectin. 

It appears they had 37,430,610 reasons to do so. 

As always follow the money. 💰💰💰 
If HCQ or Ivermectin were approved treatments, the Vaxinists would not have been able to obtain their emergency use authorisations for their experimental genetic substances. 

No wonder the likes of The Guardian betray their readers, for they are in the pockets of Vaxinists.
Facebook’s censorship of 🍀Ivermectin continues to kill people.

History teaches us that those that seek to censor free speech are always in the side of evil. 


BOUGHT 💰💰💰 

I wondered why The Guardian would knowingly print fake news & lies demonising HCQ and smearing 🍀Ivermectin. 

I should have know - for as always,  follow the money. 


It’s now our generations turn to fight for & defend freedom of speech. 

I’m almost ready to start my case Craig Kelly v. Facebook Inc. 

First documents will be filed in the Australian courts very soon. 

Facebook’s censorship has left them with blood on their hands. 
The real question is why are The Guardian intentionally and knowingly printing lies and false information? 

In the past, left wing publications would treat Big Pharma as the enemy and seek to hold them to account. 

So why is The Guardian doing Big Pharma’s dirty work ?
The Guardian may argue that the WHO doesn’t recommend HCQ.

They may argue that it’s banned in 🇦🇺 to treat 🦠

They may argue that some studies have found it ineffective

But to publish there is ‘’no evidence’’ (pretending that 193 studies don’t exist) is a deception. It’s a lie.
It’s one thing to innocently publish falsehoods because you are ill-formed

But it’s another to publish falsehoods, when YOU KNOW they are untrue

The Guardian claims there is ‘no evidence’ that HCQ works. That’s a lie. 

There are 195 published studies showing that it does. 
Believing in a policy of ‘Lockdown, Mask & Inject’ while ignoring Ivermectin will be recorded as the greatest mass delusion in history. 

As they say, people go mad in herds and only regain their senses slowly, one at a time. 

Have you awoken to the con ? 
Sack Gladys & Chant. 

Incompetent.  Totally clueless of the damage they are doing. 


Which fascist gets to decide what’s ‘’mis-information’’ and what’s an alternate opinion ?

The world has entered a very dark place. 


SHAME @DanielAndrewsMP SHAME for DESTROYING Victorian small businesses

Small business owners have reached BREAKING POINT with yet another lockdown forcing thousands of them to shut their business, cut staff & struggle to pay bills

ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING

NOT JUST @GladysB DESTROYING small businesses SO IS @DanielAndrewsMP

NO DIFFERENCE between the TWO major parties

Both major parties JUST want to CONTROL people & DON’T CARE if businesses are DESTROYED

AND they BOTH just use Police to SUPPRESS dissent !!

SHAME @GladysB SHAME

Lockdown DESTROYING

&gt; NSW economy
&gt; small businesses
&gt; communities
&gt; people’s morale

@GladysB gets paid regardless BUT people across Sydney, especially South West Sydney, face FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY about their future & livelihood !!

With @GladysB in PANIC MODE & making policy on the run, NSW economy will be DESTROYED if these lockdowns continue

&gt;Construction sector will be DEVASTATED
&gt;Small businesses will CLOSE DOWN
&gt;Workers & families won’t be able to pay their bills

DISGUSTING !!

Making policy on the run is DESTROYING the NSW economy

STOPPING essential transport workers from leaving their homes in South-West Sydney will MASSIVELY DISRUPT aviation, bus & transport networks & home delivery services

SHAME @GladysB SHAME

They say 💉 will prevent deaths

They say 💉 will prevent hospitalisation

Latest VAERS data shows these numbers are going up in US

Big Pharma disciples & apologists will say anything to push 💉

They say no ‘confimed’ link... just “coincidence”

Try explaining THAT to 💉 victim 
AND just in case the Big Pharma disciples & apologists didn’t know Ivermectin has been adopted around the world

These countries have seen through the Big Pharma propaganda AND are trying to save lives & stop the suffering

THEIR CHOICE & if they can SAVE LIVES, then WELL DONE !! 
Another HUGE red flag

Professor Sucharit Bhakdi, the most cited microbiologist in German academic history speaks out on the recently published, peer reviewed science.

His conclusion: The mass 💉experiment should be stopped immediately


Safe & Effective ? 

Over 1,000 ‘fully vaccinated’ reported dead in USA with 🦠 

So what’s the point of Vaccine Passports ? 


Hardly surprising given the daily Gladys & Chant clown show. 


Then what’s the point of Vaccine Passports ? 


New Daily Covid cases yesterday. 

Indian State of Uttar Pradesh (pop 240 million) : 77

United Kingdom : 52,871

We need to be quick and sign up Yogi before the Brits grab him to sort out the mess that bumbling Boris has created through Ivermectin denial. 
Why are we not doing the same ? 

It’s because Big Pharma has captured our government bureaucrats & politicians -  and they don’t want any off-patented cheap treatments that might disrupt their 💉💰 
Because lockdowns, masks and mass injections are the path out. 


And you thought they were insane 
Memo to our one dimensional incompetent health bureaucrats advocating for continued lockdown - please show us your modelling of the total long term adverse costs of lockdowns ? 

Can some journalist perhaps ask this question ? 
When I first read this, I thought it was a joke. 

But that’s how our (once where) Liberal Govt operates. 

Australians citizens denied the freedom to return home, but Caitlyn 
from the Kardasians gets in for the Big Brother TV show. 

Seriously Scomo ? 


Sadly, this is why I left ....

‘’The Liberal leadership has stopped being Liberal. The Prime Minister should abandon the National Cabinet, end the lockdowns & the theft of our freedoms.That is what a true Liberal would do.’’


The policies peddled by incompetent health bureaucrats, weak politicians & the group-thinking media of LOCKDOWN, MASK & INJECT - all while suppressing 🍀Ivermectin is criminally negligent in its gross stupidity & total insanity. 


Dr Ralph Carter : 

‘’The WHO say ‘no’ to 🍀ivermectin for Covid. Why? Follow the 💰

These agencies are corrupted by their funding & their intimacy with ‘big Pharma’.

No family member of mine will face this disease without a liberal dosing of 🍀it’’


We need Australian Courts to stand up for our FREEDOMS just like the Spanish Courts

Great to see Spanish stay-at-home lockdown order has been held UNCONSTITUTIONAL by Spain’s constitutional court

“Limitations on movement violated citizens’ basic rights”


AND let’s not forget about Hydroxychloroquine guaranteed to send the Big Pharma disciples & apologists into a frenzy

Demonised by the Big Pharma Cult, BUT a scientific open mind would find value in the research on HCQ

NOT all roads lead to💉 as you can see from spiralling cases 
So, what do the Big Pharma disciples & apologists say about Vitamin D as a viable medical treatment ??

OR are they so BLINDED by their overzealous membership of the Big Pharma Cult ??

Research shows lots to gain from keeping up your vitamin D levels

Your life, your choice !! 
ANOTHER REMINDER that 55 studies on Ivermectin have shown SUBSTANTIAL improvements in outcomes across the board

Those brainwashed by Big Pharma propaganda are DENYING people a CHOICE of medical treatments

REMEMBER FULLY 💉 people are STILL getting infected AND we’re in lockdown 
Infectious disease experts believe NSW hospitals can cope with infection BUT ADMIT people with cancer, heart conditions & strokes are the patients who will suffer

DISGUSTING people will SUFFER or SADLY DIE because their conditions are NOT being treated !!

JUST A REMINDER that 60 studies have considered Ivermectin AND 55 have shown MASSIVE improvements in outcomes across the board

DISGUSTING that those brainwashed by Big Pharma propaganda would DENY people a CHOICE of medical treatments

FULLY 💉 people are STILL getting infected 
SHAME on the 2 major parties for ABANDONING AUSSIES stranded overseas

AND STOPPING AUSSIES being reunited with overseas loved ones

STOP treating stranded Aussies as 2nd class citizens !!

LET AUSSIES return NOW with regular testing AND home quarantine !!


@DrPieterPeach @K_Sheldrick Pieter, good point, listen to the real experts on Ivermectin like Professor Tess Lawrie, not The Guardian


Here’s what The Guardian won’t tell you about 🍀Ivermectin. 

Attached is the summary of all the published studies excluding Elgazzar 




Chance that an ineffective treatment could achieve such positive results ? 

One in 193 billion. 
BRING STRANDED AUSSIES HOME NOW !!

People stuck overseas are AUSSIES TOO & they RIGHTLY feel as though their OWN country has all too happily “abandoned” them

AND they RIGHTLY believe Govts are using them as a convenient “scapegoat” for their own failures

DISGUSTING !!

COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE to all Aussies stranded overseas & for those kept apart from loved ones !!

SHAMEFUL HYPOCRISY 

Aussies MUST be allowed to return NOW

They can do REGULAR tests, including rapid tests AND do home quarantine !!

Get STRANDED AUSSIES HOME NOW !!

@K_Sheldrick Why don’t you put out a statement disassociating yourself from the conclusions of this shameful Guardian article, and confirm the fact that deleting the Elgazzar study has no material effect on the overwhelming evidence in support of Ivermectin ? 

@K_Sheldrick You should be ashamed at having your name associated with this propaganda.
Such misinformation published by The Guardian has deadly consequences. 

People die when they swallow such anti-Ivermectin propaganda. 



The Guardian should retract this article. 

Why is the left-wing Guardian doing Big Pharma’s dirty work ?
Why are THE GUARDIAN doing Big Pharma’s dirty work ? 

More shocking disinformation & propaganda published by The Guardian. The Elgazzer studies are not ‘’Huge’’. Excluding them has no material effect on the overwhelming data supporting 🦠Ivermectin. 


84 yr old man who was FULLY vaccinated, yet tested POSITIVE while hospitalized, has died in Israel

💉 was meant to protect elderly ?

BUT instead Big Pharma Marketing team will give us PR SPIN

“Coincidence” “old” “underlying condition”

CON JOB CONTINUES


💉 was meant to set us free ?

More “breakthrough” infections in FULLY vaccinated people around the world

But they KEEP pushing 💉

AND Big Pharma given legal indemnity to 💉 everyone

AND Big Pharma make lots of $$ while YOU take FULL risk

DISGUSTING !!

As Sydney Hospitals are being ‘stretched’ because of infections EVEN AMONG FULLY vaccinated workers

It’s DEFINITELY TIME for the Ivermectin

💉 NOT setting us free & Hospitals are being put at RISK by FAILURE to give people a choice of Ivermectin !!

So TYPICAL of SCAREMONGERING Govt, Health bureaucrats AND media

Why is The Guardian acting as a stooge for Big Pharma, deceiving it’s readers claiming there is “No evidence’’ to support HCQ, when 100% of the 29 early treatment studies show the exact opposite? 


Tell us HOW MANY NSW cases were previously FULLY vaccinated
@GladysB @NSWCHO 

FULLY VACCINATED Brisbane Airport worker tested POSITIVE was in the community & at work for 3 days while infectious

Can STILL be infectious after 💉

FULL TRANSPARENCY NOW !!

How many of the infected NSW hospital & health care workers were FULLY vaccinated when they got infected?
@GladysB @NSWCHO

Community needs COMPLETE HONESTY after FULLY vaccinated nurse got infected DESPITE 💉 AND wearing full personal protective equipment

How many cases in NSW were FULLY vaccinated when they got infected ??
@GladysB @NSWCHO

Let’s have FULL transparency after nurse at one of Sydney's busiest hospitals got INFECTED despite being FULLY vaccinated AND wearing full personal protective equipment 
So they told us 💉 would set us free

BUT FULLY vaccinated people are still getting INFECTED

AND passing it on !!

They’re using all the tricks in the book ... fear, coercion & bullying

All so Big Pharma can make lots of $$ AND you can STILL get INFECTED

And they’re trying to push AstraZeneca onto under 60s

Well, THEY should GROW a CONSCIENCE after learning how UK family SUDDENLY lost a loved one after AZ who was ONLY 44 yrs old

DISGUSTING how they don’t care so long as Big Pharma makes lots of $$

SHAME

History will judge this man. 

Anyone that wants to force masks on 3 year olds - is a psychopath that belongs behind bars. 
Another huge red flag that our health bureaucrats ignore. 


 

His warning is very dire: “These shots are causing huge damage and the worst is yet to come.”
Dr Tess Lawrie : The mass 💉 roll-out should be paused due to safety concerns. 

Watch this brave doctor’s opinion before it’s censored by Big Tech as they cover up for the Vaxinists 🏦💰


Safe & Effective ? 

More like the greatest consumer scam of all time. 

With 87.5% of the adult population having been 💉 at least once, the UK has just recorded 48,553 new cases overnight. 

‘’The Emperor has no clothes’’ 
Imagine a world, where following a medical treatment, in just first 3 days after,

💉57% suffered an adverse event
💉21% were so sick they missed work/study
💉1.5% end up at an emergency department or doctors

Yet the government told you it was ‘safe’? 


VACCINE PASSPORTS : Not only unethical, immoral & a violation of human rights - but stupid & dangerous. 

They create the false impression that someone with a 💉 Passport can’t get covid & infect others. 

They are a scam, peddled by fools & 💉$ellers.


CON JOB CONTINUES

8 FULLY vaccinated Las Vegas health care workers tested positive in a “rare” cluster of "breakthrough" infections

“Rare” has LOST all credibility

💉 NOT setting us free

Health care workers getting infected after 💉

LIES & DECEPTION

Quickly gaining attention is another potential side effect that some 💉 recipients have noticed ...

CHANGES to their periods & menstrual cycles

13,000 UK reports from those who have experienced period changes after having 💉

Your risk, your choice !!


SHELL-SHOCKED husband, still processing the sudden death of his wife after getting AstraZeneca, shares his HEARTBREAKING story

FULLY VACCINATED Brisbane International Airport worker who has tested POSITIVE was in the community & at work for 3 days while infectious

So data from

“Safe & effective”

Any other business making such a claim & then having 46.8% of customers complaining about product would get a visit from @acccgovau

Ivermectin anyone ?? 
Indonesian Food & Drug Monitoring Agency or BPOM has finally granted Emergency Use Authorization for 8 drugs INCLUDING Ivermectin to crush the wave

If Indonesia can see the VALUE of Ivermectin, so CAN Australia !!

Looks like FULLY vaccinated  nurse at  Westmead Hospital returned a POSITIVE result DESPITE 💉 AND wearing full protective equipment at work

Time for @GladysB to be FULLY TRANSPARENT on how MANY NSW infection cases had previously BEEN vaccinated !!

As we have throughout our nation’s history, we stand with these French patriots fighting for freedom. 


Are these the scenes that Morrison, Dan Andrews, Gladys and Palaszczuk want for Australian streets ?  

They must abandoned their plans for coercive plans for Vaccine Passports in Australia.

@HappyMa84218053 If the CFR for the unvaxed remained the same before the mass vaccination program started, but for the double 💉 it came down - we could give the credit to 💉.

But have a look at the data ..... 

@HappyMa84218053 The way to answer this, is to have a look at the most recent case fatality (CFR) rates for the double 💉 and the unvaxed.
@HappyMa84218053 Oh dear, sounds like you’ve joined the cult.

Yes, there is a lower rate of deaths & hospitalisations, but is this due to Delta variant becoming dominant, or is it due to the vaccines, or a bit of both?
UK : 42,302 new daily cases. 

No wonder their dashboard experienced a delay, they needed more time to count them all.

Yet we have a destructive groupthink in Australia, a delusion, that if only we had mass injections like the UK, we’d low infection numbers. 
Oops. Something appears to have gone amiss

The more they inject, the ⬆️ the new daily cases numbers go - the exact opposite of what the glossy colour brochure said

At what point does someone call out, ‘’the emperor has no clothes’’ ?

Can we get a refund from the 💉 sellers ? 

@tbooth_98 @normanswan Hate to break it to you, but more of the 💉 are hospitalised. 

@tbooth_98 @normanswan Sounds like you’ve brainwashed by Big Pharma, Big Tech & Big Media.

It’s a cult.

Our government agencies have been hijacked by a cult of Vaxinists. 

And there is no appeasing this cult. They will not stop until they have injected their experimental genetic agent into the arms of every child. 

Get ready to fight, we must stop them. 
They keep saying “safe & effective”

BUT according to data at 


So about 57% reported an adverse reaction

Just imagine if 57% of customers complained about a product !! 
How does Big Pharma suppress Ivermectin?

Big Pharma’s hold on medical bodies designing ‘treatment protocols’

Researcher fears of losing funds & promotions & dependence on positive ‘peer reviews’

Fear of losing Big Pharma largesse

AND political contacts 
An OPEN MIND on Ivermectin will set you free 

The earlier one starts Ivermectin, the better

In Indian State of UP households would begin Ivermectin once 1 family member got sick

Proved remarkably EFFECTIVE & didn’t cause deaths, strokes or blood clots

Great to see SA Liberal Senator Alex Antic joining Tas Liberal Senator Eric Abetz to REJECT vaccine passports

Vaccine passports designed to COERCE people CONTRARY to Nuremberg Code

KEEP SAYING NO TO VACCINE PASSPORTS

Just out - 36,660 new daily covid cases in the UK. 

236,076 in the past 7 days 

And that’s with 87.3% of the adult population 💉

And yet we have bumbling incompetent & clueless health bureaucrats screaming 💉💉 are the only way out. 

Why won’t they release the 🍀Ivermectin ? 
Hang on PM, what about all the Airport workers being coerced to be injected with an experimental agent (which has no long term safety data) under threat of the sack if they don’t submit ? 

That’s NOT a free country, and it’s happening on your watch !


Given that they are only just now finding this out of the short term adverse effects, I wonder what other nasty surprises will be discovered in the months & years ahead ? 

Safe & Effective ?

Truth is, they haven’t got a clue of the medium or long term effects.
SO THEY FIND THIS OUT

‘’Severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, & capillary leak syndrome have been reported of the Janssen 💉 during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials.”


The lockdowns have been the greatest assault on small business since the Bolshevik revolution. 
If at first you don’t succeed, then jab, jab and jab some more ! 
Safe & Effective - or the world’s greatest consumer scam ?

Domestic Vaccine Passports are an abomination in a free society.

Yet that’s exactly what the Morrison/Andrews/Gladys/Palzachook governments have planned. 
Zealots in NSW Education Department planning to force 😷 upon children are engaged in a form of child abuse 

The bureaucrats behind this atrocity, acting contrary to the evidence & the science, should be sacked

They’ve shown they’re are not fit to make decisions involving kids 
This one graph completely destroys the story that ‘’mass vaccination is only way out’’ which is being peddled by our incompetent health bureaucrats, clueless politicians & the media. 

Just release the 🍀Ivermectin & end the counterproductive lockdowns. 
Israel, the poster boy of the Vax zealots - Big Pharma, Big Tech & Big Govt. 

It’s time to admit, the experiment has failed. 
This a must watch

Professor Peter McCullough destroys the Morrison/Andrews/Gladys absurd ‘4-phase plan’

We should sack every bungling government health bureaucrat; Chant, Kelly, Young, Sutton - a complete clean out, & put Professor McCulough in charge

💉 CON JOB CONTINUES

Israeli data seems to show 💉 “protection” starts FADING after JUST 6 months

As vaccinated people who recently got infected had 💉 around Jan/Feb

DISGUSTING

All that risk & pain for ONLY 6 months “gain”

Time for the Ivermectin !!

At what point do you realise and admit you’ve been worshiping a fake idol ? 


UK new daily Covid infections : 34,471 

‘’Be a good child, put your arm out & you can take off the mask’’.

And that’s why they want to force masks on school kids in the first place. 

These vax-zealots are pure evil. 


At all costs, we must fight to protect the children from these vaccine extremists, for they will not stop until they have injected their experimental genetic agent into the arms of every child. 


Who needs beer adds and government propaganda ? 

Just do as Klaus tells you, get injected. 
Yes, it’s because Facebook have me blacklisted, and YouTube even censor my Parliamentary speeches. 
Putting aside the ethical debate over Vaccine Passports, this example from Houston shows what a complete fraud they’d be

Here a wedding with ‘fully vaccinated only’ guests ended up with 6 covid cases including 1 death & 2 severely ill hospitalised. 


They are not ‘Noble lies’ they are unconscionable evil untruths which are the basis of the greatest consumer scam in history. 
The NSW Education Dept is run by groupthinking dills

There is no evidence to show 😷 are effective for school kids only evidence of harm

It’s a scam all design to coerce kids to be 💉, whereby they must stay 😷until 💉💉 with the experimental agent


WELL DONE to Indian State of UP & its Chief Minister @myogiadityanath for their effective management in crushing the wave

Brilliant that UP introduced ‘Ivermectin’ as preventive measure for health workers, patients & people exposed to infected people !! 
ANOTHER TRAGEDY with South Australian Health officials confirming 72 yr old woman died after getting AstraZeneca

She’s looks more like someone suffering from clots after the 💉 than someone with 🦠

It would be an honour to visit and learn more of how UP implemented Ivermectin & achieved such great success in crushing Covid. 

However, because of the failures of our Australian governments to follow UP’s lead, we are locked up indefinitely & I’m unable to leave Sydney.

It’s a form of child abuse, designed to create fear in children, to make them more compliant in the months ahead when these psychopaths will try & start 💉 the kids 
So who is sucking up to Pfizer ?

SHAME !!


@stevepa13118816 Sorry, you’ve been tricked & brainwashed. 

Here’s the hospitalisation data from Israel, showing the exact opposite of the BS you’ve swallowed hook, line & sinker. 
I respect Greg Sheridan’s articles, but his latest is a complete nonsense. 

It ignores;

The importance of Ivermectin & Vitamin D as a prophylaxis 

That the 💉 is proving of little use use against Delta variant

That Delta has a CFR on par with the flu 


Poll finds people believe there’s a 38% chance of dying from the Delta strain

Fact : Data shows Delta’s case fatality rate is 0.2% in general (about 200 times less) & even lower for people un-jabbed at 0.13% &  just 0.03% for unjabbed ⬇️ 50 year olds. 


Menzies would be rolling in his grave over how today’s (il) Liberal Party leaders have abandoned the core principles of party’s values. 

@blackwaxy Do you own Astrazeneca shares, or are you just brainwashed ?

Professor Sucharit Bhakdi MD, I’d back him any day against the incompetent B & C graders in our government health bureaucracies.

Explains why Pfizer sucking up BIG TIME to US health officials to get booster 💉 approved 
SHAME, BIG PHARMA, SHAME

Pfizer pushing booster 💉 BACK in APR with Johnson & Johnson saying in FEB people may need annual 💉 just like flu shots

It’s so BLATANTLY about $$ for Big Pharma they’ll do ANYTHING to SUPPRESS ivermectin to make more $$ from 💉

WOW

Pfizer of course suggesting booster 💉 needed now, but US govt health officials saying NOT ‘at this time’

Big Pharma so blatantly after $$ they’ll say anything to SELL more 💉 REGARDLESS OF 💉 SAFETY

SHAME BIG PHARMA for putting $$ BEFORE 💉 safety

Ivermectin gaining ground globally as more people see through Big Pharma CON JOB

Just need Aussie health bureaucrats to see through Big Pharma propaganda

With surging cases, 💉 efficacy FALLING substantially on Delta variant, more “breakthrough” infections

@GraveBack Maybe you’ll consider the UK where the majority (63.4%) of deaths come from the 💉💉 experimental group. 

@Trader183740 You’ve been brainwashed my friend. Please do you homework, so you don’t end up a statistic. 

@harryconnic1 Dr Grouf with data sourced from 
Instead of listening to propaganda being pushed by compromised health bureaucrats and playing on our TV screens - listen to a real scientist, Professor Sucharit Bhakdi before it gets censored ......


I’m sure he’d approve. 
Latest data from Israel shows more likely to end up in hospital if you’ve been injected with the experimental genetic material. 

Don’t be conned by government propaganda. 
And by the way, this is real life. The government add is that of a paid actor.
Why are health bureaucrats continuing to suppress Ivermectin and deny sick people from accessing this medicine when the evidence is so overwhelming ? 


OVERWHELMING evidence for Ivermectin

Criminal to keep SUPPRESSING potentially life saving medical treatment JUST so Big Pharma can make more $$ as people suffer, die or are in lockdown around the world

SHAME

GIVE PEOPLE the CHOICE to use Ivermectin NOW

ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING

The BLATANT SCAREMONGERING is DISGRACEFUL

The other is society suffering untold social & economic costs

I’ve often wondered what it would have been like to live during the dying days of the Roman Empire, as society, enlightenment & reason came crashing down

When a beer add promotes a medical experiment, I understand what it would have been like. 😓 
But our health bureaucrats continue to deny its value and suppress its use. Malfeasance of the highest order.

Any chance they could loan us their Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to release the Ivermectin sort out the mess our hopelessly incompetent  State Premiers have created

When have you ever heard any of our health bureaucrats ever talk about the importance of Vitamin D ?

Are they just totally incompetent - or is it they only care about power & control ? 


They are lying to us. Again.

Labor & those that have hi-jacked the Liberal Party are planning Domestic Vaccine Passports & compulsory 3rd 💉💉💉.

Medical fascism & control is the future they want for the nation. 

Please help me fight this. 


OUR GOVERNMENT IS LYING TO US 

The ‘Four Phase Plan’ is another deception.

The headline asserts ‘’manage covid like the flu” - but the details state that Vaccine Passports will be compulsory for interstate travel, & compulsory 3rd 💉 for everyone. 

It’s a medical fascism. 
Today’s Liberals and Labor - what’s the difference? 
Weekly cases adjusted for population remain elevated in 6 of world's most vaccinated nations & 5 of them rely on 💉 from China

POINTS to dodgy Chinese 💉

EXCEPT UK ALSO has surge in cases BUT using AZ etc

So maybe JUST dodgy 💉 NOT coping with Delta 🤔

Israeli govt says analysis shows Pfizer seems MUCH LESS effective against infections caused by Delta variant

So with all the rush to 💉 in Australia the world is finding out that 💉effectiveness is DROPPING substantially !

BUT they SUPPRESS Ivermectin 🤔

TIME to STAND UP for your FREEDOM OF CHOICE to make YOUR OWN medical decisions

@ForMenai Your prejudices, ignorance and stupidity is contributing to death and untold suffering.

Please go away, read the science (most of it peer-reviewed) on Ivermectin and educate yourself so you are not harming others. 

Gladys - you’ve been conned by the vaccine sellers

If you think injecting everyone gets you to near zero cases, just look at the most injected place in the world - the UK

Their cases are skyrocketing.

Delta is on par with the Flu. The lockdowns are bullshit. 
YOU’VE BEEN CONNED GLADYS BY MEDICAL FASCISTS - THIS IS BULLSHIT

If we follow the science & use Ivermectin, Zinc, Doxy, Vit C & D no one has to die, and hardly anyone will need to go to hospital.




Your lockdowns will kill many more people than you save. 
We’ve lost the plot. Our state has been hijacked by unelected health bureaucrats

What plague of madness has infected the world, where we allow unelected 2nd rate health bureaucrats to call the shots as they assert its ‘safe & effective’ to inject novel experimental genetic agents into people, while asserting Ivermectin & HCQ are too dangerous to risk trying? 
Be warned ⚠️

Understanding the unintended consequences of 💉 with researchers studying reported menstrual changes following 💉

AFTER 1000s of women have reported changes in their menstrual cycle on CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) 🤔


#BloodOnTheirHands

This highly successful 🍀Ivermectin study saved everyone that took the treatment. 

However 2 subjects declined the treatment (perhaps influenced by anti-Ivermectin propaganda peddled by a politicians, media personalities & vaccine sellers) They both died. 
We should spare a minute to weep for the over one million dead, denied treatment of the life saving combination of medicines; Ivermectin, Zinc, Doxycycline, Vitamin C & D all due to the malfeasance and/or incompetence of health bureaucrats who were only interested in the 💉. 
Every government health bureaucrat that has denied or suppressed the truth on Ivermectin, thereby denying the sick & the dying from accessing this medicine, should now resign immediately, for they have blood on their hands.
GAME OVER 

New Study : 

‘’Ivermectin is a safe, inexpensive & effective early COVID-19 treatment validated in 20+ RCTs ...... we trialed this novel combination comprising ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc, and Vitamins D and C. It was highly effective.’’


Gladys have your NSW health bureaucrats informed you that the DELTA strain has 1/20th to 1/10th the Case Fatality Rate of the original Alpha strain ? 

If not, you must SACK THEM ALL for Malfeasance - and then end the lockdowns immediately !


The great freedom fighter & protector of individual liberties demands Australians rights must be curtailed in violation of the Universal Declaration of Bioethics & Human Rights  


Another US State NOT keeping track of all “breakthrough” infections

That means LACK of real-world data to check 💉 efficacy & CAN HIDE surge in cases among those vaccinated

CONVENIENT FOR BIG PHARMA that numbers NOT tracked

SHAME FOR HIDING TRUTH on 💉

TRUTH always 1st casualty of info war !!

“Breakthrough” infections growing concern in Mid-Missouri in US, BUT local media has NOT been able to get answers for ‘past few weeks’ on how many breakthrough cases there are

Incompetence or something to HIDE ??

So Big Pharma now ADMITTING 2 doses NOT setting us free as promised 

Pfizer seeking FDA authorisation for booster 3rd shot of 💉 as it ACKNOWLEDGES its 2 dose 💉 has FALLING efficacy against Delta variant

WOW

They want to 💉 FOREVER

IVERMECTIN ANYONE ?


💉 is not setting us free as promised because of variants, questions about 💉 efficacy & “breakthrough” infections

Nearly 30 people in US State of Louisiana died from infection DESPITE full doses of 💉

And “breakthrough” cases keep coming 

Ivermectin ?? 
UK’s drugs regulator has added HEART INFLAMMATION to official list of side effects for Pfizer & Moderna

You guessed it !!

“Rare” “Benefits outweigh risks”

BUT NOT for the people who get the heart inflammation !!

If you are claiming that, your ignorance is causing death, disease and misery. 

And if you are claiming that to promote sales of the 💉 you belong in jail, for a very, very long time. 
We should never forget how our Chief Medical Officers, health bureaucrats & many politicians aided & abetted this propaganda campaign that cost so many lives

Yet today Dr Risch Professor of Epidemiology at Yale would face jail in Qld for prescribing HCQ


Professor Risch talks about how hydroxychloroquine was fraudulently misrepresented & suppressed by public health agencies, academic journals & the mainstream media. A propaganda campaign that resulted in the preventable deaths of 100,000’s of people.

Delta variant & “breakthrough” infections are EXPOSING the LIE 🤔

Ivermectin anyone ??

The Vaccinists are out of control. 

We can not them inject their experimental genetic agents into Australian children under the pretext of keeping the adults safe. 
I believe that history will show, that those who locked down children, forced them into masks, keep them away from school & now want to inject them (to protect voting adults) will be found to have committed crimes against humanity.


Lockdowns cost lives. 

But fascist health bureaucrats don’t care. They love the power, & lockdowns are great to scare people to submit to participating in the world’s largest medical experiment. 



@Inferno0696085 You are right, as it’s limited to the 3 days only straight after 💉AusVax is likely to underestimate the adverse events.



AusVax Safety report 47.5% adverse effects based on responds to an SMS/email they sent to people in the 3 days after 💉

But TGA only report 0.46% adverse events, based voluntary responses



Are the TGA out by 100 fold ? 
SAFE & EFFECTIVE ? 

46.4% of Aboriginal & TSI receiving 💉 reported no adverse effects 

💉 53.6% reported any adverse event
💉1.8% reported seeing a doctor or going to emergency department in the days after vaccination.


ONE RULE FOR THEM ....

Klaus, Bill and other global elites want to make it more expensive for average citizens to fly, but will exempt all their private jets from the same the punitive taxes. 


Just to clarify for the sad mindless trolls cheering on foreign billionaire oligarchs to censor political debate in Australia 

I’m suing Facebook for defamation & misleading or deceptive conduct under 🇦🇺laws before 🇦🇺 courts. 

Trump is suing under the 🇺🇸Constitution. 
Health bureaucrats not just suppressing Ivermectin, they’re SUPPRESSING the TRUTH about 💉

Surgeon who operated on Italian girl who died at the age of 18 from effects of 💉 said he’s NEVER seen anything like it before

Very SCARY to know the damage caused

NZ reports 4,521 adverse events as of June 5 with 180 reported as serious

DISGUSTING how health officials are so DISMISSIVE of 💉 adverse events ... “only a handful of people" “by chance”

They MINIMISE problems with 💉 BUT SCAREMONGER on Ivermectin !!

THIS IS NOT MEDICINE - ITS A HORROR SHOW 

As a last stand, we must protect Australian children from the fascist health bureaucrats running the country and the experimental genetic vaccine sellers. 
ANOTHER young man gets heart inflammation days after Pfizer

23 yr old considers himself fit & active person with doctors now ‘investigating’

Amazing that health officials just can NOT readily accept link with 💉 BUT are QUICK to reject Ivermectin

SHAME 
CAN’T HIDE TRUTH FOREVER !!

TGA confirms death of 61 yr old WA woman last month was likely linked to AZ

External vaccine safety investigation group of experts found 💉 was likely cause due to lack of evidence for other causes & time frame of getting 💉 


FOLLOW THE PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE 

‘🦠 Subjects treated early with azithromycin plus Ivermectin or HCQ showed overwhelming improvements’ 




I call on every government health bureaucrat that misled the public on Ivermectin & HCQ to resign. The CMO must go ! 
The greatest consumer fraud in history is starting to unravel. 


Looking forward to taking Facebook to Court in Australia to stand up for Freedom of Speech

Big Pharma narrative FALLING APART in Israel big time !!

Big Pharma NOT setting us free

Ivermectin anyone?

The (once were) Liberal’s plan .......

Forget listening to highly experienced doctors like Professor Peter McCullough, let’s get our medical advice on the experimental genetic agent (never used in humans before, & which has zero long term safety data) from CELEBRITIES !! 
Time to hear the TRUTH about the 💉 from people who are SUFFERING the consequences !!

SHAME, Big Pharma, SHAME 
See those tan coloured figures in the chart - they represent deaths that could have been avoided if it wasn’t for government health bureaucrats suppressing 🍀Ivermectin as a treatment.

Suppressed, so they could sell the 💉


National Covid Evidence Taskforce : 58% ⬇️ in death if you take 🍀Ivermectin compared to ‘standard government approved care’

Yet, unbelievably they still suppress 🍀 Ivermectin by recommending against its use. 

Malfeasance of the highest order. 


To put children at risk, by injecting an experimental agent into them, not to protect the children, but to protect adults, is a total abomination. 

But this what the vaxinists demand. 

They are zealots that want to inject everyone & they don’t care about the consequences. 
Dr Peter McCullough : ‘’STOP this has gone wrong, it’s a giant biological disaster’’

But our clueless health bureaucrats & group-thinking politicians want to continue to inject as many as they can. 


Safe & Effective ? 

One of the most vaccinated places in the world is the UK, with 67% x 💉 and 50% x 💉💉

But their number of new daily 🦠cases  continues to surge.

The grand experiment has failed. 
QUERCETIN

Dr Zelenko was censored & deplatformed for saying what this peer-reviewed study has found




68% ⬇️ hospitalization

Quercetin is a zinc ionophore as is 🍀Ivermectin & HCQ. Fancy that 🤔

But always ask your Doctor

Big Pharma NOT setting us free

Delta variant, FALLING 💉 effectiveness, more “breakthrough” infections, blood clots, heart inflammation, more lockdowns

Looks like team from marketing running the show !!

Now pushing booster 3rd 💉

1st they told us 💉 would set us free

Shame, Gladys shame. 

You’ve allowed out of control, unelected clueless government health bureaucrats to take over the running of the state.

How many small business will this continued lockdown destroy ? 
And what about the pathetic reporting on the headline by the equally out of control ABC 

‘’school secured jabs for students’’ making out this is some type of good thing they’ve obtained. 



‘Error’ ? 

How in the hell do you inject 160 school boys with an experimental genetic agent ‘in error’ ?

Jab happy NSW Health are out of control - the police should be called in. 

At the very least this is criminal negligence.

Canada tells those who experienced myocarditis and/or pericarditis after first dose of Pfizer or Moderna should “wait to get their second dose until more information is available”

How about EVERYONE waits to get FIRST dose until more info is available 🤔

As of mid-June, 65 cases of heart inflammation reported to Health Canada after 💉

Normally occurring at about 1.5 per 100,000 BUT increases to close to 3 cases per 100,000 after 💉

Should be ringing BIG ALARMS BELLS 

AND lead to calls for IVERMECTIN !!


MARKETING 101 

When you’ve been flogging a dodgy product, and the public finally catches on, rebrand the product under a different name. 


Robin Saunders, an employee of a Baltimore hospital was forced to be 💉 or lose her job

June 21 she received the 💉

After receiving 2nd 💉 she had severe reaction to it & was admitted to the ICU with brain swelling/heart issues & passed away. 



‘Safe & Effective’ - one of the greatest lies ever told. 
With 67% x 💉 and 50% x 💉💉 UK are predicting 100,000 new daily cases soon 

If you think that following the UK’s lead & having high rates of 💉💉 is the path to low infections (every media outlet in 🇦🇺) you’ve been conned

Consumer scam of the century


Cyprus : yet another case study, to show that if you think high community rates of 💉💉 are the path to low infections - you’ve been conned.

The crime of century is unraveling. 

(il)Liberal Government locks Sydney down for at least another week.

NOTHING TO SEE HERE 🙈🙊🙉

This week’s US data for 12-17 year-olds alone shows;

💉12,674 total adverse events, incl. 720 rated serious & 13 reported deaths

💉1,792 reports of anaphylaxis

💉300 reports of myocarditis & pericarditis

💉52 reports of blood clotting disorder 

‘’These 💉 are a choice for adults, take them or don’t. That’s the the stuff of a private and personal choice in an erstwhile free society. BUT LEAVE THE CHILDREN ALONE’’ 

And then there’s the ABC’s Dr Swan 

‘’We are standing at fork in the road. A society that even contemplates putting children in the front line to protect adults (by 💉 them with experimental agents), far less one that embarks on such a strategy, is a society that is not worth saving’’ 

‘’These 💉 are experimental, no data is available for long term effects ... That we are even contemplating giving these 💉 to children when so much remains unknown strikes me as nothing short of grotesque’’ 

‘’Never before in human history has there been a proposal to vaccinate children from a disease that poses them no measurable harm’’

Yet we have ‘celebrity TV doctors’ that have not treated a single covid patient, yet they want to mass inject Aussie kids with experimental agents 
We don’t need any absurd undefined ‘4-Phase plan’ based on half-baked ideas and fallacies, that sounds like it was written by the marketing arm of 💉 manufacturers. 

If we follow the evidence and the science - need the 🍀Ivermectin 
Nothing to see here 🙈🙉🙊 

Just move along a line up 🐏🐏 
But think of all the lost sales for the 💉 makers !! 
And all our health bureaucrats and media in Australia have followed Fauci like he was some Demi-god. 
Where does it end ?

New variants challenging 💉 experiment at every turn with India's 'Delta Plus' variant sounding new viral ALARM BELLS

Like a deadly serious game of 💉 vs variants with variants increasingly “breaking through” & reducing efficacy of 💉


@realLlewen Since you asked, UK data shows lower mortality rate for those in the control group (i.e those that decided not to be injected) by a factor of ten-fold. 
A DISGUSTING cash grab by the NSW Liberal Govt

🇮🇱ISRAEL 
57% ‘fully vaccinated’
But 55% of the newly infected in Israel are ‘fully vaccinated’

Big Pharma salesmen now says the ‘fully vaccinated’ likely to need a third 💉 to be ‘fully vaccinated’

WAKE UP - WE ARE BEING PLAYED 


Of course, Mr HUNT would say ANYTHING to move AZ DESPITE ATAGI recommending AGAINST it for under 60s

Qld’s Chief Medical Officer is right about AZ & under 40s & she has backing of Europeans

STOP the name calling & attacking our freedom of choice Mr HUNT


And all under an (il)Liberal government. 😥 
Israel sees DECLINE in Pfizer efficacy rate due to Delta variant

With 55% of newly infected having been vaccinated

AND Israel is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world

Does NOT fit 💉 narrative

But Big Govt here SCAREMONGERING to 💉 everyone

Big Pharma’s big experiment a big disappointment with investigation underway into how Belgium care home came to be infected with Delta variant, while 95% of residents & 75% of staff were “FULLY” vaccinated

💉 was meant to set us free

Ivermectin anyone ??

SHAME 💉 makers for EXCLUDING immunocompromised people from clinical trials

NOW there’s limited info on how this group is reacting to 💉

“Overwhelming majority of transplant patients appear to have suboptimal protection — if any protection”

Be warned ⚠️

Let’s call a spade a spade. 

The World Health Organisation’s malfeasance over 🍀Ivermectin is both corrupt & criminal that has resulted in hundred of thousands of preventable deaths.

The WHO have blood in their hands. 
Listen to the Doctor ....... 
Exactly. 
Informed Consent or Ingorance is Strength? 

How many of those corralled into being injected, know that the mNRA genetic 💉 are experimental, have never used in humans before and have no medium or long term safety data ? 


Lies, distortions, censorship and alarmist exaggerations have been the tools of trade of those wanting to force their experimental genetic substances upon the world. 

Therefore the public are unable to give truly informed consent. 
An excellent letter by a law firm in the UK which applies equally in Australia. 

With the brainwashing, propaganda, censorship, & coercion hundreds of thousands are being injected with an experimental substance without giving informed consent.


Federal Govt is SO HEARTLESS it’s now BLOCKING children of Australian families stuck in India from flying home with volunteer guardians

This is APPALLING !!

But Labor & all the lefties are just as HEARTLESS for letting Govt GET AWAY with everything !!


Now the SCAREMONGERING begins to help supermarket chains build their online grocery business & make lots of $$

So no one will leave their house for shopping because of "fear" of going to a hotspot

This will kill off already struggling small businesses

REALITY CHECK needed ⚠️ 
How things have changed !!

With people so quick to dob in someone without a mask

If only they're so quick to report REAL CRIME, but no, they don't want to get "involved"

So typical of nasty bullies to dob in others on technicalities

Must get some sick pleasure to call Police 
SERIOUS concerns on 💉 for immunocompromised people, like transplant recipients & people with blood cancers

With many people being immune-suppressed, concerns MUST be addressed so NOT to expose this group to 💉 RISK

Let’s have REAL informed consent !!

Aussie UNIONS must stand AGAINST vaccine BULLYING 

US Union representing over 450,000 healthcare workers voicing opposition to employer vaccine mandates

It’s an employee’s CHOICE & Unions MUST stand up for that CHOICE

Mandate = BULLYING

STOP IT NOW !!

Say NO to vaccine passports !!

We must STOP this erosion of our personal freedoms BEFORE it's TOO LATE !!

Let's fight this together & WIN !! 
Be warned ⚠️

New modelling study published in European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control’s Medical Journal has concluded that the DANGERS presented to younger people by AZ are GREATER than the benefits

SHAME PM for pushing 💉 onto younger people !!

DISGUSTING Pfizer & Moderna have NOT done comprehensive study on how 💉 affects those with immune issues

WOW ... Big Pharma NOT interested as NO $$$ in immunocompromised people after early studies show 💉 may NOT help them

Big Pharma ONLY after easy $$$

Is this what our country has become ... people turning on people with some RUSHING to DOB IN others ??

It’s a technique long used by COMMUNISTS to allow them to BULLY & CONTROL their citizens

Report SERIOUS crime, of course BUT don’t allow us to be DIVIDED by Bully Big Govt !! 
It's DISGUSTING how our Govts are DESTROYING businesses with their endless lockdowns !!

It's far too easy for Govts & health bureaucrats to simply order a lockdown

Another example of where 💉 may NOT set you free ⚠️

Early research shows that 15 - 80% of people with certain medical conditions, eg. specific blood cancers or organ transplants, are generating few antibodies after receiving 💉

Need Plan B

Ivermectin ??

When PM wants to be tough on borders, Aussies get RIPPED OFF

ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING Italian regional health authorities started running vaccination “open days” to get rid of unused AstraZeneca doses to young people with an 18yr old dying

Sounds familiar with PM wanting to get rid of AZ here to young people

SO WRONG

If it’s REALLY “safe & effective” why does Big Pharma want an indemnity ??

Pfizer & Moderna have supplied 💉 to countries ONLY after they get indemnities against costs of compensation for adverse effects from 💉 that might arise post vaccination

SO WRONG

Say NO to employers having access to staff vaccination data

An employee’s vaccination info should NOT be made available to employers

It’s a massive breach of privacy & can lead to workplace bullying & discrimination of employees who CHOOSE not to get 💉

It should be made a criminal offence to censor and hide scientific information from the public. 

Facebook executives should be imprisoned if they continue with such conduct. 
We cannot allow a single Australian child to be 💉 with this genetic experimental agent which has no long term safety data. 

Get ready to stand & fight.

Just imagine the lives saved with

End the lockdowns, burn the masks & incinerate the 💉


This is what they call ‘informed consent’ ? 

Looks more like a dodgy marketing pamphlet, designed to conceal the true risk and overstate the benefits  


A disgrace. This is not the Australia that our forefathers fought to build.

It’s politicians that have spread mindless fear & senior police for lack of directions that are too blame 

There is no science anywhere that shows 12 year-old should be masked


You don’t need research study to tell you locked borders are having highly DETRIMENTAL impact on the mental health of my Hughes constituents & those across Australia SEPARATED from loved ones overseas !!

I hear their heartbreaking stories everyday

Federal Govt is just HEARTLESS 
So we now have some of the toughest border controls globally that are even trying to stop citizens coming back HOME

We're not even letting people OUT of the country

Our ANZACs fought to keep us FREE but Big Govts are keeping us locked up

Say NO to the erosion of our Freedoms ! 
Norway suspends AZ but we do NOT

Among those suffering badly from 💉 were health workers who were ‘prioritised’

2 women hospitalised in March & 1 of them in her 40s died with another man in his 30s STILL suffering from severe immune reactions

TROUBLING

Saddest tragedy of all is when a teenager dies 3 days after getting Pfizer

U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention investigating case involving 13 yr old

Preliminary autopsy findings suggest an enlarged heart with fluid around his heart

TERRIBLE !

Looks like PM's approach is generally  'hit & miss'

Take 1 - everyone to have 💉 by October 21
Take 2 - "war footing" to get rollout back on track
Take 3 - looking for the Horizon
Take 4 - Phased approach

What next ?

Police State headed by a friendly Commissioner ?

TROUBLING 
More than 16,000 reports of suspected side effects of 💉💉 have been recorded by end of June in Norway

They suppress Ivermectin DESPITE lots of evidence supporting its safe use BUT allow 💉 with 10,000s of adverse effects

The HYPOCRISY is DISGUSTING !!!

Why did the chicken cross the road ??

So the Police Force could do it's new found job of forcibly arresting those not wearing masks

Welcome to the Police State !!

AND they wonder why the community loses faith in the Police

Politicians should STOP misusing the Police Force 
At least 3 claims for serious side effects of AZ UPHELD in Norway leading to financial compensation

OFFICIALLY confirmed AZ currently suspended in Norway resulted in severe cases of blood clots & low platelet counts in these patients with 1 dying

FINALLY

Just 13 years of age. 


NEW WARNING ON 💉

Health Canada warns ‘capillary leak syndrome’ possible side effect of AstraZeneca

It’s a serious condition that causes fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries)

You guessed it “very rare” UNLESS you’re affected

Be warned ⚠️

Adverse effects must NOT be dismissed !!

UK woman whose fiance died after getting AstraZeneca is urging people NOT to be fobbed off when reporting side effects

Dismissing adverse effects can cost your life or that of a loved one

Your risk, your choice !

‘Vaccine Targets to unlock the path to freedom’ ? 

I call bullshit.

This is just marketing spin, to sell more experimental injectables. 

Look at the UK - one of the most 💉 nations of all. 

Their case numbers are exploding - over 27,000 daily new cases again yesterday. 
And given the voluntary & passive nature of the reporting, this is likely only the tip of the iceberg




And even so, these are just the short-term adverse effects

What will be the  medium term adverse effects ?
What will be the long term adverse effects ? 
On the data, the evidence and the science I think he’s right. 

But on the hysteria, panic and mindless groupthink going on, he’s wrong. 


And yet, we are offering this to all Australians.

A collective madness has descended across the nation, where reason, logic and precautionary principle are being disregarded.


My previous view was 💉 should be freely available to all (with informed consent) but mandatory to none

But on new data & speaking with doctors I’ve changed my mind, including that with mass brainwashing ‘informed consent’ is not occurring

The entire 💉 program must be halted
Watch Dr Peter McCullough describe how he prescribed Hydroxychloroquine to his own Dad to fight to save his life. 

Then remember Palaszczuk & Young have criminalised this & Dr McCullough would be facing jail if he practiced in Qld

I known who belongs in jail. And it ain’t Dr.M 
I believe we should use this ‘Polish template’ to protect freedom of speech. I’m hoping to have this drawn up as legislation and introduced in the next sitting of the Australian Federal Parliament. 


Poland has it right. The censorship of a Noble Prize winner must be the straw that broke the camels back. 

Big Tech must treated like ‘utilities’ and reined in with anti-censorship laws. 

We need to follow Poland’s example to world. 


To understand the level criminality & affront to civilisation of YouTube’s fascist censorship of Dr. Satoshi Ōmura, it’s worth watching this video of the immeasurable benefits to humanity that resulted from his discoveries. 


If anyone has the right to express a medical opinion it’s Dr Omura.  I’m going to do everything I can in Parliament to try & legislate to stop this type of censorship. Tech giants that censor such lawful speech need to be broken up into pieces and face multi-milliion dollar fines
When the fascists at YouTube censor the Noble Prize winner Dr. Satoshi Omura, a man whose discoveries have saved a hundred million + from blindness, the world has entered a very, very dark place. 

I cannot express in words how angry & sad this makes me & fearful for the future. 
Follow the peer-reviewed science on 🍀Ivermectin 


Straight from the marketing department- the Government’s 4-Phase plan.

Where have I heard that before ? 
Watch : 
North Carolina : 1,400 ‘’fully vaccinated’’ contract Covid with 105 hospitalizations and 18 deaths in the US state. 

This just demonstrates the complete nonsense of the National Cabinets 4-phase plan. Vaccine passports are just a marketing exercise.  


How many other doctors can say they’ve treated and saved 6000 covid patients ?

BE WARNED ⚠️

Aussies deciding to get 💉 could be left seriously out-of-pocket if they get blood clots

Nothing to lose to use Ivermectin under medical supervision

Who are you going to believe ??

Frontline doctors directly saving lives every day or bureaucratic doctors sitting behind a desk being fed Big Pharma propaganda ?? 🤔

More infections, more lockdowns !!

So 💉 not setting us free as promised 🤔

Time for Plan B

Ivermectin anyone ??


National Cabinets ‘4-stage plan’ 🤡🤡🤡🤡 is a farce. 

It’s based on the nonsense that widespread 💉💉 is the path to low community infections & normality.

Great to have a world class facility in my Hughes electorate !! 

@janehansen2000 ‘’The vaccines stop you dying’’ ? 
Tell that to the 700+ people in the USA that have died of Covid after being 2 x 💉💉 and tell that over 5000 that died on the VAERS list after being 💉

Please wake up, you’ve been brainwashed 


FLYING BLIND

Firstly, the TGA have no accurate method to determine all adverse events after 💉💉 - they are voluntarily reported. 

Secondly of 335 deaths, shouldn’t it be that TGA has disprove there’s no link, rather than the other way around  ?


More evidence supporting Ivermectin !!

DISGUSTING how lives are being lost globally & we’re stuck in endless lockdowns

Just because health bureaucrats can’t think outside the Big Pharma box or are scared to tell the truth & being attacked like Qld Chief Medical Officer on AZ 
UK : 27,989 new daily cases. 

And that with 66% x 💉and 49% x 💉💉

Yet we have stupid ignorant brainwashed people here in Australia asserting that high rates of 💉💉 are the path to low infections & ending lockdowns. WAKE UP WE ARE BEING PLAYED 
Need to make sure China & Fauci are ACCOUNTABLE for their actions !!

They both have a lot to answer for !!

CENSORSHIP KILLS

Health fascists seek to censor when they fear discussion

‘’Those who coddle such demands sow the seeds of our undoing. To reject scientific inquiry, is effectively an invitation to a dark age, where progress comes to a halt.’’


Morrison’s, Andrews & Glady’s Australia ? 

Unconstitutional ‘Domestic Vaccine Passports’ will be a new form of apartheid. 

I never thought a ‘Liberal’ Government, or the party of Menzies & Howard could do such a thing 😓 
I no longer recognise the nation I grew up in 😭

A plague of madness has descended the land, & we’ve meekly surrendered our freedoms & become a totalitarian state under martial law, all over a variant 🦠with a lower Case Fatality Rate than the flu


Is the Pfizer mRNA 💉 better or worse than the Astrazeneca for young men ? 

Are these rates of Myocarditis worth it for a strain with a lower CFR than the flu ? 

Why aren’t our incompetent health bureaucrats providing the data so people can make an informed decision ? 
MORRISON CALLS FOR COMPULSORY VACCINE PASSPORTS 

When I warned about the threat of Domestic Vaccine Passports, I was called a ‘conspiracy theorist’.

Tonight, our PM has confirmed that’s what he plans for Australia

Our nation will never be the same😓


So the marketing geniuses told us the 💉 would bring it to an end

BUT then came the blood clots & heart inflammation, followed by the Delta variant & surge in cases

If only we hadn't followed the marketing geniuses & used the Ivermectin instead !! 
Hardly a single mention of this in the entire Australian media. 

All we hear in brainwashed sheeple trying to create panic & fear to get to buy the 💉💉. 
If you were head of Marketing you would be out of a job if customers STOPPED buying your product because they thought it was DANGEROUS

And you would be planning a new marketing strategy if consumer demand fell from 60% to just 10-20%

Time for Ivermectin 

Wondering why PM pushing AstraZeneca onto under 60s CONTRARY to ATAGI recommendation AGAINST those under 60 getting it ??

Well, Federal Govt remains bound by a contract with CSL to produce 50 MILLION doses of AZ

Could he have just bought FAR TOO MANY ??

Say NO to vaccine passports

19 US states have banned vaccine passports to some degree, typically through executive orders with most but not all, of these states being Republican-led

My Private Member’s Bill will BAN them in Australia !!


If it’s “safe & effective” WHY do we need a new no-fault indemnity scheme for GPs to give AZ to Aussies under 60

Who compensates people who take risk after GP persuades them to take 💉 DESPITE Govt’s OWN expert group - ATAGI - recommending AGAINST it ??🤔

Malaysian Govt reconsidering its previous decision to administer Pfizer to adolescents

This follows reports of incidents of side effects relating to heart inflammation, especially among male recipients

Why risk lives of healthy young people ?

DISGUSTING

Federal Govt MUST keep election promise by setting up strong, effective national ICAC or Anti-Corruption Commission

Links between Ex-MPs/Ex-Staffers with Big Govt, Big Pharma, Big Business & Big Tech MUST be investigated !! 

I stand with @helenhainesindi 
Say NO to vaccine passports

Canadian Province of Saskatchewan will NOT require vaccine passports to work & attend events as they would violate Province's Health Information Protection Act

My Private Member’s Bill will BAN vaccine passports in Australia 
Members of US military who were 💉with Pfizer or Moderna showed higher-than-expected rates of heart inflammation

Experts found reports of myocarditis were higher in males & in the week after 2nd 💉 than would be expected in general population

TROUBLING 
New Study : 

‘’A recent review concluded that there was ample evidence for adverse effects of wearing such masks ...which suggest that children should not be forced to wear face masks’’




I said this 12 months ago, and was attacked by the groupthinkers. 
Woman sadly dies in UK 5 weeks after getting 1st dose of AZ in Australia

Just another coincidence !

ATAGI recommends AZ ONLY for those over 60 BUT PM says it's "safe & effective" for those YOUNGER

Risking people's lives for political expediency is WRONG

END THE HYSTERIA & END THE LOCKDOWNS NOW ! 

Look at the data 👀

Compare the case fatality rate (CFR) for the current ‘Delta’ against the original ‘Alpha’ variant. 

Then compare this against the CFR for influenza.

I AGREE !!

ATAGI advice REMAINS AZ only recommended for those aged over 60

WOW - the TRUTH will set you free

Fight between Federal & State Govts over whether AstraZeneca should be given to under 40s has ESCALATED with Queensland’s Premier & Chief Health Officer openly accusing Scott Morrison of RISKING lives of young people !!!

A case of poor marketing or poor decision making?

Nothing to see here. 🙈🙉🙊

Just move along and line up 🐏🐏🐏

and roll up the sleeve 💉💉💉

We need more 🐁🐁🐁 for the experiment


It’s over. The grand experiment has failed. 

Time for Plan B. 
Sack them all and release the 🍀Ivermectin 
Looks like more variants means more booster 💉

Big pay day for Big Pharma's big experiment $$$

While you're kept in lockdown & forced to have 💉 which NSW Chief Medical Officer says is less effective against the delta variant !! 
Their lies are increasing in size and becoming more desperate as time goes on. The data on the Delta variant shows it’s less deadly than the flu. 
I call Bullshit. 💩

They are lying. Again. 

Although Delta may be more contagious, look at the data and make up your own mind about claims ‘’it’s deadlier”.

It’s lying & scaremongering, to get you to submit to lockdowns & 💉💉 
We're almost there, we're told

Big Pharma has got this under control, we're told

Big Govt will keep us "safe", we're told

💉 will set us free, we're told

YET PM can't give us a firm timetable, just an horizon to seek

BUT will we ever get there with the current approach ?? 
Get ready to fight. 

Klaus and his buddies at the World Economic Forum want to team up with Big Tech to control & censor the internet. 

This is exactly what Orwell warned us about. 


And WHO was meant to be that independent body the world could trust on health matters

Instead you have Comrade China with Big Brother Bill calling the shots with China's interest being to stop Wuhan Lab being exposed & Bill Gates obsessed with 💉💉 the whole world

Simple !! 
Say NO to mandates

Your risk, your choice !! 
The most scary thing about covid, is how otherwise intelligent people have been brainwashed into thinking that volunteering as a Lab Rat in a medical experiment will result in the government handing them back their freedom 

@EZACKT It’s easy to see how so many are easily brainwashed when Zac 🤯doesn’t understand that India has a population of 1,393 million, more than twenty times that of the UK.
Before I give Dr Young to much credit, on this data how can you recommend any mRNA 💉 to young men ? 

But in our fact free state of madness & hysteria - does the data even matter ? 

& as for ‘informed consent’ how many young men lining🐏 up for the experiment are told this👇🏼👇🏼 

@Adam_Creighton The bottom line is, that the data is clear as mud.
@Adam_Creighton On the ‘benefit’ that’s based on the original alpha variant - now we are dealing with delta - which is showing around 75% less deadly. 

The benefit also doesn’t make any allowance for early treatment. 

And on the risk - that’s doesn’t include the unknown long term risk.
What a joke. All these useless MP’s gave tens of thousands of taxpayers $ to Facebook to buy likes

I was getting over a million FB interactions a month (likes, comments & shares) without spending a cent

Perhaps that’s why Facebook defamed & censored me


I never thought I’d say this, but I’m watching brainwashed people talking nonsense on Sky, and Qld CMO Dr. Young is right - even the old data shows the risk is greater than the benefits for under 40’s. 






@giveback12345 You do know, that you are acting as a ‘useful idiot’ for the vested interests of giant pharmaceutical companies ? 

They are playing you as a fool. Getting you to do their dirty work. 

🍀Ivermectin is off-patent, any lab can make it for cents. There is no money it.

UK Govt says NO to vaccine passports

UK Cabinet agrees it's time to 'live with Covid'

WON'T impose requirement to show proof of vaccination to attend UK mass gatherings

Let’s all stand up for our Freedoms !!

Although the Labor Party & Unions have abandoned all the airport workers, happy to see them forced into a giant medical experiment, where they’ll be injected with a novel experimental substance, which has zero long term safety data- at least the Lab Rats are prepared to speak out 
Say NO to vaccine passports !!

At least 18 US states led by Republican governors or legislatures PROHIBIT creation of so-called vaccine passports or BAN public entities from requiring proof of vaccination

My Private Member’s Bill will BAN them here !!

NSW Chief Health Officer points to concerns 💉💉 NOT as effective on Delta variant

AND “very committed to following the ATAGI advice” that advises under 60s AGAINST AstraZeneca

So if 💉 less effective on Delta variant, then more “breakthrough” infections

And Barcelona is also seeing a spike in cases

Lots of 💉💉 AND lots of cases

What’s going on ??

Does NOT fit the narrative of Big Pharma’s big experiment setting us free !!

INSTEAD we’re being locked up !!

For our “safety” of course 🤔

Did anyone say Ivermectin ?? 
Cases spiking in Russia

Looks like “variants” getting out of control

Meanwhile, Ivermectin still being suppressed !!

So more cases, more “breakthrough” infections, more lockdowns 🤔

Where does it end ?? Big geniuses running the show, running out of ideas

Ivermectin anyone ? 
Workers are not lab rats.

No Australian worker should be forced to participate  in a medical experiment coerced by the threat they will lose their job.

Big Pharma’s big experiment not setting us free as promised

Tragic that Big Govt, Big Pharma, Big Science & Big Tech stubbornly pushing Big Experiment & suppressing ivermectin

DISGUSTING !!! 
The lockdowns have made us an international laughing stock 


War is Peace
Ignorance is Strength 
Mass Vaccination is the path to Freedom 
Frontline doctors saying Ivermectin MUST be part of world-wide response

Time to listen to frontline doctors who save lives day after day, while health bureaucrats have meeting after meeting promoting Big Pharma while Delta variant spreads & we’re in lockdown time after time 🤔 
Polling shows that Aussies simply can NOT live without oil & gas in their lives

Without oil & gas there would be NO hand sanitiser, NO PPE equipment for medicos & NO computers for working at home

REALITY CHECK for those wanting to shut down oil & gas !!

We were told Big Pharma’s big experiment was going to set us free

But then came Delta variant

And then came lockdowns

Even in Israel with one of world’s highest 💉 rates

So Big Pharma’s big arrogance letting us down big time

Ivermectin to the rescue ?

Truth is the first casualty of any information war

Big Pharma’s big propaganda machine does everything it can to promote its big experiment for big $$ & to suppress low cost competitors like Ivermectin !!

Big Media & Big Tech censorship is DISGUSTING & costs lives !!

Here’s just some the evidence they ignore.

So all drug companies have powerful govt relations teams with former Govt staffers to help Big Pharma do deals with Govt

AstraZeneca is no different with Ex-senior Liberal staffer in their govt relations team

TROUBLING 🤔

Time for independent inquiry !


I’m sure this will be widely reported by the ABC and rest of the Australian media🙈🙉🙊 
JUST IMAGINE 

6 months + after you started (in the middle of winter🥶)
🇬🇧 largest mass injection scheme in its history 
reaching 65% x 💉 & 49% x 💉💉
& you’d spent billions of 💷💷
that come the middle of summer 🥵
New daily cases were more than 50% ⬆️ than when you started 🤯 
Scandal ? 

More like crime of the century. 


The Biggest Lie (perhaps ever) was at Ivermectin didn’t work

The Big Lie has reward a handful with billions, but it’s also killed millions

Those suckered into the repeating the Big Lie (DrAlly & Dr Tanya and countless others) need to apologise & repent 


3rd Dose ?

The idea of being ‘’fully vaccinated’’ by having 2 x 💉💉 was always part of the con. 

For once you’ve submitted to Vaccine Passports - you’ll never be ‘’fully vaccinated’’ - they’ll always be another shot. 


So looks like key scientists advising the WHO had done paid work for Big Pharma which are pushing their big experiment

What a surprise ?? 🤔

No wonder the WHO suppresses Ivermectin

And of course Bill Gates joins in !! 


What’s wrong with the Chief of Staff’s to our Premiers & PM ?

Has the cat got their tongues ?

Or are they too afraid to upset the vested interests of Big Pharma with their big donations to Liberal/Labor ? 


Could 450 medical doctors from Japan be wrong ? 

I bet there’d be at least an equal number in Australia, but they’ve been bullied & intimated into silence by our health bureaucrats, with threats of de-registration for following the Hippocratic Oath. 


More evidence in support of Ivermectin

We’re not allowed by Big Govt, Big Science, Big Pharma & Big Tech to question 💉

BUT Ivermectin with lots of favourable evidence gets SUPPRESSED 

DISGUSTING !! 



You can’t trust them when they change their view like the weather !!

Aug ‘20 PM moved to assure Australians any 💉 would NOT be compulsory -

"Nobody's going to force anybody to do anything”

Jun ‘21 & closer to an election people are being forced

SHAME


SOME may find fact AstraZeneca had former Liberal staffer in senior lobbying role ‘hardly surprising or scandalous’ 🤔

Or see nothing wrong with Big Pharma being ‘hugely influential in Canberra’ 🤔

So no one would object to Federal Integrity Commission !

And still Ivermectin SUPPRESSED while Govt gives AstraZeneca every chance DESPITE other countries having gone cold on it

Surely, not a case of Govt having bought so much of it that it now needs to “move it quickly” ??

Can’t be any Liberal links to AZ ??

Maybe Inquiry time ? 🤔 
Collateral damage. 
Safe & Effective ? 
Unconscionable madness. 

It’s is reckless madness, unconscionable panic, putting young Australians at mortal risk, to endorse under 40s to be injected with Astrazeneca. 
And the NSW Liberals want to make the experimental injections compulsory for airport workers. 

You ignorant stupid bastards. How dare you do this to any worker.

@redsash1993 Damien, before you embarrass yourself further.o and study what ‘prophylaxis’ means. 

Then please go and read all the science and evidence about Ivermectin as a prophylaxis. 


They want to flog off the Astrazeneca they over-bought. 

Little different from a dodgy Kebab shop trying to flog off chicken kebabs because they’d over-ordered on the chicken and it was going off, even though it might make people sick.
And remember this same 🤡🤡 show that now indemnifies doctors for injecting stuff THEY KNOW the risks outweigh the benefits, still wants to jail doctors from prescribing Hydroxychloroquine. 

Unbelievable.
UNCONSCIONABLE 

Last week following more blood clots, AstraZeneca was banned for all under 60s as "the risk outweighed the benefits’’

Now National Cabinet is indemnifying doctors to inject a substance in people that THEY KNOW the risks outweigh the benefits. 

Just Criminal 
We have our clown show health bureaucrats running around like chicken littles over the deadly DELTA mutation? 

Here’s the data .....


National Cabinet - What complete 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 Show

Last week the CMO said of Astrazeneca that the risks outweighed the benefits all under 60’s

But know they want to inject all with it. 

And where’s the discussion on Ivermectin and Vitamin D ? 


Govts be warned !

Research shows imposing 💉 mandates counterproductive given people don’t like being manipulated by Govt actions that restrict their freedoms

Forcing people into medical experiment only leads to greater distrust of Big Govt & Big Science

QB3NKQIkuA
@paranoidfemoid You’ve drunk the Kool-aid. If the 🦠💉 are safe & effective, why is a person that has been injected (twice) worried about a person that doesn’t want to be experiment on ?
On Jan 28, 2021 Slovakia became the first EU nation to approve 🍀Ivermectin 

The arrogant English, rejected 🍀Ivermectin & pushed for mass 💉

Today the UK (one of most 💉 nations) has a new daily infection rate of 216/million, while Slovakia as new infection rate of just 8/mill 
Where are the Unions ? Where is the Labor Party ?
They’ve abandoned workers

No one should be SACKED for refusing to participate in a medical experiment, where they are forced to submit to being injected with a genetic experimental substance which has zero long term safety data 
Looks like “Breakthrough” infections where people are getting infected EVEN AFTER being “fully vaccinated” are here to stay

Makes vaccine passports USELESS as a person with one could be allowed to travel while infected risking an “outbreak” & lockdown 🤔

Dr. Aaron Kheriaty : ‘’The risks outweigh the benefits for college-age students’’

CENSORSHIP KILLS

Dr. Pierre Kory : 

‘’Physicians across the country are fighting a pernicious campaign to denigrate all potential treatments not first championed by the authorities, & others have faced retaliation for speaking up’’


DISGUSTING & UNCONSCIONABLE that majority of people dying in England with now-dominant Delta variant have been vaccinated

How many would have benefited from Ivermectin ??

We won’t know just because Big Pharma & Big Science continue to suppress it

SHAME


Safe & Effective ? 

608 (at least and counting) dead in the USA from Covid after being so-called ‘’fully injected’’


Absolutely essential to keep China accountable !!

“Gain of function” research is DANGEROUS & RECKLESS

We URGENTLY need ANSWERS about Wuhan lab & CSIRO links with research by scientists from the Lab 
Safe & effective ? 

On this data, only a fool would make 💉💉 compulsory 
If it’s ‘’safe & effective’’ as advertised, why is the AMA worried about having indemnity? 
Looks like some infected people who are vaccinated may still transmit infection 🤔

Risk of “breakthrough” infections & transmission even after being “fully vaccinated” makes vaccine passports DANGEROUSLY MISLEADING as person having one may be infected !!

And so it begins. 

The NSW liberal government is requiring domestic vaccine passports/certificates for all airport workers. 

Get ready to fight. You shouldn’t be forced into a medical experiment, and injected with this stuff just to keep your job. 


Note that Lebanon also has greater mobility this month. 
Safe & Effective ?

🇱🇧Lebanon only has 5.8% of its pop ‘’fully vaccinated’’ compared to 🇮🇱🇮🇱Israel’s 59.7% 

Yet 🇱🇧Lebanon (18/million) now has a lower number of new daily cases per capita than 🇮🇱Israel (21/million) does. 
Sign from the massive London weekend protest. 

If those involved in the crime of the century think they can suppress the truth forever, they are sadly mistaken. 
The Ivermectin deniers are collectively responsible for over a million deaths. 
Given many of our Chief Medical Officers have repeatedly claimed there is ‘’no evidence’’ to support Ivermectin, I’d suggest they avoid travelling to India in the years ahead. 
Random protest in Sutherland. 
More people are waking up everyday 
Being told of more “waves” of infection, lockdowns & restrictions on our Freedoms, you would think Govts & medical profession would URGENTLY see if there were any existing treatments available that could make a difference

Wasn’t Big Pharma’s big experiment going to prevent this ??

And remember, what is described as ‘’observed’’ is actually only what is voluntarily reported. It’s likely be higher, but the fact is we don’t know. We are flying blind. This is madness. 
Emeritus Professor Robert Clancy calls for 🍀Ivermectin & HCQ  to be ‘’immediately established’’ as a ‘’safe & effective early treatment’’ based on ‘’overwhelming science’’ to ‘’save lives’’. 




I wonder what DrAlly & DrTanya might say about this ?

FB’s censorship is not only killing people, it’s a threat to democracy. While other MP’s suck up to Facebook, I’m going to be fighting them in the courts & in Parliament. Watch this space

Here’s great example of the dishonesty & deceit of Facebook

A factual post about Poland planning to fine the likes of FB $2.2 million for blocking lawful content (reported by Reuters) was deceptively branded ‘’False Information’’ because its contrary to FB’s commercial interests 
When the Tech Giants of Facebook and YouTube censor the opinions of people like Dr Pierre Kory and Dr Tess Lawrie, the Tech Giants are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.

So WRONG when scientists & doctors become political activists supporting Globalist political agenda with Big Pharma & Big Govt 
US Food & Drug Administration adds WARNING on risk of heart inflammation to "fact sheets" for Pfizer & Moderna

Warning notes increased risk of heart inflammation after reports of adverse events following 💉- especially after 2nd dose 🤔

Know the risks !!

TROUBLING number of adverse effects from 💉

Official Aussie health data shows that 48.8 % of survey participants reported adverse effects from 💉

They trash ivermectin with lots of evidence supporting its use but see no problem with rushed rollout of 💉

So experts say it's "normal" to feel "sluggish" or "unwell" post 💉

Survey finds after 1st 💉 of AZ - 1 in 5 reported missing work, study, or other routine tasks, with nearly 1 in 4 reported missing similar commitments after 2nd Pfizer 💉

Know the risks

How about, for every day a lockdown goes on, all politicians and all senior government bureaucrats have a 20% pay cut - so we can sing 🎶 ‘’we are all in this together’’ 🎵 
Follow the science  ....... 
Why is it that those that oppose Ivermectin by (falsely) ‘’there’s not enough evidence’’ are to first to demand lockdowns and masks despite there being no evidence of the effectiveness of either lockdowns or masks ?

Another open minded doctor not fooled by Big Pharma propaganda to suppress Ivermectin

With more "breakthrough" infections & lockdowns, there's NOTHING to lose to break out the ivermectin under medical supervision !!

DISGUSTING how suppression of ivermectin is costing lives !! 
A few things this paper could have also considered

The ☠️rate from the 💉 is not only likely underestimated it could also grow over time, as medium & long term adverse events are unknown. 

The benefits could alternatively be safely achieved with Ivermectin prophylaxis.

When the UK started the mass injection experiment 🐁on Dec 7, 2020 they had a daily new infection rate of 14,774

Over 6 months later and with the population 65% x 💉 and 47% x 💉💉, they have a new daily infection rate of 15,374

That doesn’t seem to follow the narrative 🙉🙈🙊 
Delta variant putting Big Pharma's big experiment to the test with real possibility that it will FALL SHORT !!

More "breakthrough" infections where "fully" vaccinated people can still get infected

More lockdowns & restrictions

A FALSE sense of security

This 💉experiment on children must be terminated immediately.

Those that continue to inject children with this stuff as part of an experiment, must be placed on noticed they will face charges of crimes against humanity in the near future.

In the meantime you might want to educate yourself by listening to Dr Yeadon 


It wasn’t so much the ‘arrogant west’ - it was incompetent ‘C-grade’ health bureaucrats taking instructions from Big Pharma, a politicised media and cowardly group-thinking politicians - combined they’ve caused over a million avoidable deaths. 
Big Govt said Big Pharma's big experiment would set us free

BUT about 50% of adults infected in outbreak of Delta variant in heavily vaccinated Israel were "FULLY VACCINATED" with Pfizer

Now Govt reimposing RESTRICTIONS

Beware of FALSE sense of security

I always wondered what level of madness was required before ordinary citizens would engage in ACTS OF PURE EVIL

When Make-a-Wish forces terminally ill kids & their families to be injected with an experimental genetic agent - we have reached that point😓


So Panama officially adopts Ivermectin & the death rate drops significantly

What an amazing coincidence !!

I wonder what the odds of that are ??

When will the sheep see through the Big Pharma propaganda that has WRONGLY suppressed Ivermectin 
Latest US data shows 4,115 people have been hospitalized or died DESPITE being "fully" vaccinated with 750 having died

These "Breakthrough" infections make vaccine passports DANGEROUSLY MISLEADING as the person with a "vaccine passport" could be INFECTED 

Welcome to Orwell's 1984...

Great to see open minded people standing up against Big Pharma's SUPPRESSION of Ivermectin

CBDC would be a country’s "official" currency in electronic form & raises concerns with privacy & govt surveillance

Another dr. working with sick Covid patients, the Head of a hospital in the Argentinian province Tucumán, officially recommends ivermectin:

"Ivermectin is very noble, reduces viral load & has minimal side effects’’

But our bureaucrats refuse to listen


Israel was the poster child of Big Vax. 

Now they are going to back to compulsory masks as cases rise. 

Why don’t they just follow the science & release the 🍀Ivermectin ? 


Listen to the Doctor ....

Dr. Bhakdi has published over three hundred articles in the fields of immunology, bacteriology & virology .......


But some will instead listen to bloke from the footy show and ‘take the shot’ 
On this data, to give males under 24 years of age a 2nd shot would be nothing other than medical malfeasance of the highest order

And remember;
🙈the VAERS data is likely massively under-reported
🙉this only one of the short term risks
🙊medium & long term risks remain unknown

132.3 BILLION reasons to SUPPRESS Ivermectin

Global market for jabs is projected to reach US$132.3 billion by year 2025 up from the US$267 million estimated in the year 2020

Not surprising Big Pharma will do anything to protect its BIG money maker !!


Race to understand variants amid growing fears virus may evade jabs & lead to MORE "breakthrough" where "fully" vaccinated people still get infected

Delta variant appears better at evading jab with 2 shots of AZ giving just 60% "protection"

TROUBLING 🤔

Seychelles having vaccinated substantial proportion of its people says so-called Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, is behind surge in cases

So lots of jabs BUT surge in cases 🤔

Is Big Pharma big experiment giving false sense of security ??

Ivermectin gets thumbs up in Argentina

Great to see medical experts being independent thinkers more interested in saving lives with low cost, easily accessible treatments, than participating in Big Pharma's big medical experiment that makes them lots of $$

I call on our health bureaucrats to immediately release their data to support their claim of ‘benefits outweigh the risks’ of a 2nd shot for young males aged under 30 

And until they can, they must immediately suspend all 2nd shots for males under 30. 


SAFE & EFFECTIVE? 

'I don't think the benefits outweigh the risks in that cohort,' said Dr. Malone, referring to people in the 18 to 22 age bracket, 'but unfortunately the risk-benefit analysis is not being done’

These fools are making it up as they go


Big Tech censors Dr Malone, the man who invented mRNA technology. 

We are living the same very dark times that Orwell tried to warn us about. 

Big Tech is today’s Big Brother,  censoring the truth to protect vested interests.


Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA technology: 

‘’The government is NOT being transparent about the risks'’

‘’Young adults and teens shouldn’t be forced to get the 💉’’

Fancy that, the government & the bureaucrats are lying to us. 

Breaking ...... 


Scotland study in Lancet finds AstraZeneca could be LESS effective against Delta variant

Findings have major implications where Delta variant is most prevalent & the population is getting AstraZeneca 🤔

With cases in ages from 25-72 & with 72 yr old woman dying

But "nothing to worry about"

UNCONSCIONABLE how Big Pharma is suppressing low cost treatments !! 
Try explaining "rare" to 323 cases of heart inflammation The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention have verified in those who got Pfizer or Moderna

Cases of myocarditis & pericarditis have been seen in teens & young adults from 12-39 yrs old

SCARY !!

Every day the health bureaucrats dig in, and refuse to admit they were hopelessly wrong on Ivermectin, thousands die. 

But they’d rather protect their reputations than protect the lives of others. 

How do they sleep at night ? 

#CrimeOfTheCentury

How long until they start arresting those that suppressed early treatment with Ivermectin & HCQ/Zinc to obtain ‘emergency use’ approval of the experimental genetic💉

Any why did those in the media close their eyes, aiding & abetting the crime of the century? 
Official Ministry of Health website Tucuman Argentina : 

‘’Ivermectin used as a prophylactic, the probability of not getting sick is 8 times more compared to a patient not using Ivermectin’

Why do our health bureaucrats continue to suppress Ivermectin? 


How do these Ivermectin deniers sleep at night, knowing they continue to block sick and dying people from accessing medicine ? 
What a hopeless waste of police resources 

Regardless, there is little evidence a 😷 would do anything
Where are the randomised trials showing their efficacy? 

Police should be investigating bureaucrats for malfeasance for the suppression of Ivermectin


BE WARNED

US Food & Drug Administration will add a WARNING to jabs produced by Pfizer & Moderna about "rare" cases of heart inflammation in teenagers & young adults

And they still want to INFLICT the big medical experiment on young people

DISGUSTING !!

NSW Liberals - what a disgrace 

You can find half a billion dollars to hand out lavish subsidies for wealthy inner city greens so they can virtue signal with electric cars - but you won’t duplicate the dangerous Heathcote Rd bridge.

We are we not listening to the experts & following the science by using 🍀Ivermectin to help control the current outbreak in parts of Sydney ? 

It’s as though our health bureaucrats would be happy to see a major outbreak 
So sad. I thought Hill was one of the good guys. But looks like he’s back on the side of darkness & evil

Crime ? 
It’s part of the crime of the century ! 
But once brainwashed into the cult of Faucism 💉, the data showing the effectiveness of 🍀Ivermectin doesn’t matter. 


A Malaysian Consumers Ass has lodged a police report against the Health Ministry for refusing to use Ivermectin

"refusal to consider the effectiveness of Ivermectin is a criminal offence that had caused more than 2,300 Covid patients to die in Malaysia’’


Only about 12 months and 2 million deaths too late. 

But nothing could be allowed to interfere with $100 billion big vax industry. 


We must release the 🍀Ivermectin

Health bureaucrats and the media that refuse to acknowledge the prophylaxis efficacy of Ivermectin, and only consider the 💉 are putting lives at risk. 

#IvermectinHesitancyKills

Those irresponsible Faucists that have injected children with this experimental stuff should lose their licences. 

And where the child has died after being injected, they should be charged with manslaughter. 


They need the cash to hand out subsidies to wealthy inner-City green liberals for expensive virtue-signalling toys (electric cars). 
The Case for 🍀Ivermectin: 
Craig Kelly MP, Australian Federal Parliament, House of Representatives, 22nd June 2021. 

Watch : 
Here’s the the official link to the No Domestic COVID Vaccine Passports Bill 2021 on the Australian Parliament’s website : 


UK Parliamentary Committee says there's “NO JUSTIFICATION” for vaccine passports

I AGREE & my Private Member's Bill will BAN vaccine passports here in Australia

If you agree, contact your Federal MP asking them to support my Bill to BAN vaccine passports

Growing concern Delta variant may lead to more "breakthrough" infections, where fully vaccinated people can still get infected

"Breakthrough" infections make vaccine passports MEANINGLESS as people having one may be infected giving false sense of security 
I’m speaking in the Australian Federal Parliament on 🍀Ivermectin in about 10 - 15 minutes 

Live link :  
As always, follow the money 💰💰💰💰

No is going to make millions or billions from off-patent Ivermectin, so it’s suppressed and the evidence censored🤐


Is this where we are headed ? 

Arrested unless you participate in the global medical experiment, submitting to being injected with a substance which was zero medium term, long term or inter-generational data on adverse effects ?  

Remembering the days when people went to libraries to research an issue by reading 'everything & anything' on a topic & kept an OPEN mind rather than just consulting those sources confirming their pre-conceived or indoctrinated view

A great letter (1 of 2 pages)

Written by a medical doctor to the PM on Vaccine Passports. 
Growing number of US "breakthrough" deaths where people get infected & die even after being FULLY vaccinated

Vaccine passports are dangerously MISLEADING as a person could still get infected after being fully vaccinated

Say NO to vaccine passports !!


WRONG & DISCRIMINATORY to punish people for refusing to participate in MEDICAL EXPERIMENT

More "Breakthrough" infections- where those fully vaccinated still get infected- make vaccine passports USELESS & EXCLUSION for not having one WRONG & DISCRIMINATORY

Vaccine passports are USELESS given "breakthrough" cases where you can still get infected even AFTER being FULLY vaccinated

So far US state of Utah has 993 reported "breakthrough" cases with 106 being hospitalized & 3 dying

Say NO to vaccine passports !!

3rd shot ? 

What happened to ‘’fully vaccinated’’ after 2 jabs ? 

Don’t tell me they’ve lied again ?


If ‘Vaccine Passports’ are not stopped, there’ll never be a ‘last one’


The luckiest 🍀 drug in the world

But our health bureaucrats continue to recommend against it. 

Is it because they are frightened to admit they’ve made yet another tragic blunder ? 


So what’s the point of Vaccine Passports ?
Victoria (6.7 mill) has a similar population to the US state of Massachusetts (7 mill). 

Massachusetts has already had 4000 covid infections amongst the so-call ‘’fully vaccinated’’. 



@gorskon Can you explain this ? 

 

Or this 
Ivermectin for COVID-19.

Early treatment - 76% improvement, p &lt; 0.0001
Late treatment - 46% improvement, p &lt; 0.0001

And yet, some still remain in denial.

Great to see Liberal Senator Eric Abetz join in my campaign to BAN vaccine passports in Australia

I look forward to more Parliamentary colleagues on ALL sides joining me in banning vaccine passports

Write to your own Federal MP asking for their support

Even before you consider the unknown risks, on the data, which one do you think is most effective ?

@AFranzsen ‘’Debunked’’ ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 
By who ?
Having DrAlly go ‘’online overnight’’ and supposedly debunking a study because of a persons nationality doesn’t count. 
Sad your comments reflect the brainwashing that’s occurred.
At present, 16 US states—Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming—all have prohibited proof-of-vaccination requirements at all or some levels of government. 
This is great site to bookmark, as it updates ‘No Vaccine passports’ legislation in the US states 

State government policies about proof-of-vaccination (vaccine passport) requirements - Ballotpedia 
Another US state says NO to Vaccine Passports and legislates to outlaw them. 

Well done, Wisconsin - lets hope in Australia we can do the same. 


It was always about the money 💰💰💰💰💰💰

Suppressing Ivermectin & HCQ was essential to facilitate the most profitable crime in the history of the world. 
If you’ve been an Ivermectin denier, it’s game over. 

You’ve not only lost, but your ignorance, arrogance & stupidity has helped cost over a million lives. You’ve cheered on mass murder.

Thank you @jjchamie 
Health bureaucrats that interfered in the sanctity of the Doctor/patient relationship & stopped doctors from using Ivermectin, need to be arrested & brought before the courts to explain their crimes against humanity that has caused these deaths

Ever wondered how AstraZeneca is made & what are its "ingredients" ?

Well, researchers have found so-called "protein impurities" leading to debate as to whether these impurities could be linked to strong reaction seen in many people 2-3 days after jab


Your risk, your choice when it helps protect you from 💉 risks !!

Our health officials have been slow in updating advice adding to risk & uncertainty

"Trust us" does NOT work when overseas health officials moved quickly to stop AZ in certain age groups

Vaccine passports raise big concerns about data privacy, methodology & 💉💉 themselves given "breakthrough" infections

Big Pharma to sell lots of 💉 to make lots of $

Big Tech to push vaccine passports to make lots of $

Poor consumer is all stitched up 

Big Govt, Big Tech & Big Pharma would love to turn vaccine passports into DIGITAL IDs

Where are all the so-called human rights defenders?

Where are the lefties who used to fight Big Govt, Big Tech & Big Pharma tyranny?

Orwell's 1984 Big Brother is HERE

Know the risks

APS (Antiphospholipid Syndrome) blood clotting disorder affecting 1 in 2000 people identified as AstraZeneca risk

People may not know they have APS - women may be diagnosed due to pregnancy complications & men after stroke or heart attack 
Vaccine passports are a DIRECT threat to our Freedoms

They can be used

&gt;to EXCLUDE you from day to day activities even if you're NOT infected

&gt;to TRACK you & your user data even after pandemic ends

&gt;as an IDENTITY card

Say NO to vaccine passports !!


Do you want Domestic Covid Vaccination Passports introduced in Australia ?
YES  or NO ? 
It’s time to decide what type of Australia we want

I bet MENZIES would have said NO to a Domestic Vaccine Passport 
After I read the Bill into Parliament, it’s up to the Morrison Govt to decide IF & WHEN they bring the Bill on for debate & vote

This is a test for the Morrison Government, if they DON’T bring the Bill on for a vote, we will know that they planning to introduce VACCINE PASSPORTS
Tomorrow, Mon 21 June at 10.10am I will introduce the ‘No Domestic Covid Vaccine Passport Bill 2021’ to the Australian Parliament

I have drafted the Bill similar to that of Florida Governor DeSantis’s Bill

Debate on 🍀Ivermectin? 

The vested interests don’t want debate, because they know they’ll be exposed as frauds & liars, who through their suppression of 🍀Ivermectin have the blood of hundreds of thousands on their hands.


With such facts & data, International Vaccine Passports would be worse than useless, they’d be misleading. 
We need to wake up. Every time we appease climate alarmists with new subsidies or restrictions, we transfer wealth and economic, political & military power to the Chinese Communist Party.

Sadly many politicians are selling us out to 🇨🇳chasing green votes


The oppressive restrictions on freedoms & personal liberty by government bureaucrats has been a political awakening of millions. 

A third force in politics is brewing that is sick & tired of the vested interests which unduly influence the Big political parties of Liberal & Labor 
When a so-called Conservative party goes woke, leftist & green to appease the media and those unlikely to vote for them - what could possibly go wrong ? 



‘’All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others’’

Especially lefty government bureaucrats that seem to enjoy restricting the freedoms of others. 



@Graffa89 All that shows is how effective India’s use of Ivermectin has been, and that the English are more likely rush off to be tested.
Buried in the National Covid Evidence Taskforce’s website is this graph, which shows that the studies have found 🍀Ivermectin reduces the risk of ☠️ by 67%

Surely the data shows that the potential benefit of saving lives outweighs any risk 

Yet they still recommend against it 
Oops ! This doesn’t fit the narrative. 

The term ‘’fully vaccinated’’ is nothing other than Orwellian Doublespeak, part of the propaganda to misled & deceive the public on a global scale. 

And for those skeptics, here’s the source for these graphs 
How is it possible that the most 💉💉injected place on the planet, also is the very same place that has the highest number of new infections 🦠🦠per capita.

I look forward to the ABC publishing this data, 🤫and seeking to explain it 🤐 
Buried in their website, Australia’s National Covid Evidence Taskforce 
admit that 🍀Ivermectin

⬇️Risk of death
⬇️ ICU admission
⬆️ Chance of Discharge from hospital
⬆️Chance of Clinical improvement 

But this 🤡 show still recommends AGAINST its use 


China produced over 1,000 Million Metric tonnes of steel last year. 

Australia produced around 5 MMt 

But some believe if we close down steel production in Australia, we can stop bad weather. 

Are these climate alarmist insane, brainwashed or just bad at maths ? 
I wouldn’t trust these clowns to put a band-aid on my finger

They should have all resigned this week, because they ignored overseas evidence allowing 800,000 + Aussies to undergo medical treatment for they’ve admitted ‘the risks outweighed any benefits’

An incompetent 🤡 show 

First they said there was ‘’no evidence’’ despite European nations suspending the 💉

Then they said it was OK for 50-60 year-olds 

Now they admit that 800,000 + Australians have been injected with an agent which ‘the risk outweighed the benefit’ 
They have your children & grandchildren in their sights. 

Are you going to stand up and fight, or sit back watch as our kids are coerced into a medical experiment, where they are injected with material which has zero longer term safety data ? 


Israeli study shows patients are far more likely to die, or to end up in severe or critical condition if they're vitamin D-deficient

It's criminal that health bureaucrats have not even promoted vitamin D

Even this simple measure could have saved lives !!

This video is more evidence that a complete madness has descended upon the world


Seychelles with high rate of vaccination has highest rate of weekly new cases per capita AND 2nd highest rate of deaths per capita

We've told roll up your sleeve & everything will be ok

It's a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY given millions of lives lost

Here's more evidence👇👇

Suppression of ivermectin & censorship of any concerns with the 💉💉 is putting lives at risk by stopping informed debate on dangers of Big Pharma experimental research products

What are Big Govts, Big Tech & Big Pharma afraid of by suppressing debate ??

At the G. Mukhari hospital in Pretoria, chief intensivist Dr Nathi Mdladla is now prescribing 🍀Ivermectin

He said "In the last 2 weeks I have been given hope as my patients are given a fighting chance (Ivermectin) is now making an impressive difference from morale to outcomes’’ 
Crime of the Century 

Suppressing Ivermectin was essential for Big Vax to obtain Emergency Use Authorisation for their 💉 

If they admitted the truth on Ivermectin, there was no billion $ payday for Big Vax.

BREAKING NEWS

Looks like Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisations (ATAGI) has recommended to Federal Govt that AstraZeneca only be administered to people aged 60+

If true, why hasn't Federal Government made this PUBLIC ?

Lives are at risk !

A sign of the times 😥

Food products used to have  a ‘’Best By’’ or ‘’Use by’’ a certain date. 

But in Parliament House it’s only ‘’MUST use by’’, but by a specific time, down to the very minute. 
At first I thought this was a joke, but then I realised it was filmed in Victoria. 

Therefore, it’s highly likely it could be the latest joint effort of the Victorian Labor Govt and the (once were) Liberal Federal Government to get you to line up🐑. 

🧐And I wonder why that would be ? 


Greek health officials join other countries in saying that AstraZeneca vaccine should NOT be given to those under 60

But Aussie Health bureaucrats  arrogantly & stubbornly IGNORE growing world-wide move to STOP endangering those under 60 !!

DISGUSTING


Dangerous climate change ? 

Or a conjob to frighten people so they’ll meekly surrender their freedoms ? 
UK medical experts raising 'serious ethical concerns' about vaccinating children because of the tiny risk they face of becoming seriously ill with infection

We need MORE common sense rather than the reckless pursuit of big profits by Big Pharma !

SHAME !

Children bribed with FREE ICECREAM so they’ll line up to be injected with a novel experimental genetic agent, which has zero long term safety data.

And again, The Simpson predict the future : 

US Health Officials say there's been more reports of myocarditis & pericarditis- inflammation of heart muscle & outer lining of heart following Pfizer jab

"Breakthrough" cases where you can get infected after being FULLY vaccinated means "vaccine passports" are USELESS

So US Doctors say it's critical to get tested if showing symptoms even AFTER the jab

AND there's still a possibility of spreading infection

Need to keep close eye on "breakthrough" cases where you can still get infected after being fully vaccinated

Just line up 🐁 🐀and roll up your sleeve 💉

Twice 💉💉  + a booster 💉

And you’ll get a certificate 🎟 and🎗to wear on your arm


When they could no longer deny the evidence, our bumbling health bureaucrats ignored the standard of most European nations & set the age limit for the AZ at 50 rather than 60 

Now it looks like they got that wrong as well, & 52 year old Aussie is  dead.


The mad & discredited Fauists, now want to inject the children.

The Faucists assert ‘’the benefit is worth the risk’’

But what they mean is it’s THEIR benefit💰💰💰

and YOUR CHILD’S risk 🐀🤕☠️


Imagine a world where such evidence exists

Imagine a world where thousands die daily of Covid

Imagine a world here health bureaucrats suppress access to Ivermectin as a preventative knowing such evidence 

Welcome to the mad insane world of 2021. 
Sad financial realities when you lose a family member from "rare" reaction to jab

Widow of a man who died after a "rare" reaction to AstraZeneca is calling for a better support package to help families who have lost loved ones to jab

Your risk, your loss

Medical staff at a Thai Hospital have confirmed that a 60 yr old man died from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy shortly after receiving AstraZeneca jab

Another tragic coincidence as wife said he was a fit & healthy man

When will health bureaucrats learn ?? 
Aussie medical experts want age limit for AstraZeneca reviewed after latest death

But our Health bureaucrats stubbornly stick with current age limits DESPITE other countries reviewing their age limit

What happened to erring on the side of caution?

SHAME

Something VERY WRONG going on at US Govt agency that approves drugs

It's just approved injectable drug costing $56,000 yearly with little evidence of efficacy leading to health experts on its advisory panels RESIGNING

But cheap ivermectin gets suppressed


#Lockdowns #MaskMandates #SocialDistancing #TravelRestrictions

Are only for the peasants. 
Despite the mass vaccination drive with around 75% residents receiving at least one dose & nearly 58% fully vaccinated, cases in Chile have SURGED 17%

Why?

The great experiment not working as promised

&gt;NOT 100% effective
&gt;"breakthrough" cases
&gt;variants


Looks like US Govt Agency that approves drugs is too close to the Big Pharma it regulates

Seems that new, expensive drugs get approval without enough evidence of effectiveness

Different rules for cheap drugs like ivermectin that may save lives !

SHAME !

@peteb1975 @LiberalAus @ScottMorrisonMP Peter, that’s why I left, sacrificing a lot, as my voice of this was being silenced inside the liberal government.
🤥SAFE & EFFECTIVE? 

Italy has banned the AZ 💉 for all under 60s

Australian health bureaucrats claim its ‘safe’ for ages 50-60 

But Annastacia at 51 especially arranges not to take AZ.

WE ARE BEING PLAYED. 

One rule for them, another for everyone else. 
Reports of AstraZeneca being associated with slightly increased risk of some bleeding disorders, SEPARATE to blood clotting syndrome that was linked to AZ previously

Of course, "rare" unless you get the bleeding disorder

Your risk, your choice !!

I tried to tweet the link to this story, but Twitter won’t allow it. 

Big Tech believes that ‘Ignorance is Strength’. They’ve censored the facts, as they don’t want you to know. 

But search for : ‘Canadian immunologist and 💉💉 researcher Byram Bridle, Ph.D’ 
And the Swiss were given a choice at the ballot box. 

Unlike Australia where the two major parties sing from the same NET ZERO hymn sheet and deny the public a say. 


Calls to investigate link between jab & Tinnitus (a ringing or buzzing noise in your ear) with at least 2,250 people in US reporting they developed the condition after getting the jab

This follows reports of sudden hearing loss

Your risk, your choice !!

It’s time for PLAN B 

🦠 Sack every senior government health bureaucrat.

🦠 Amend our Competition Laws. Criminalise Big Pharma investors spreading misinformation on the competition

🦠 Stop Big Tech censorship

🦠 Release the Ivermectin & HCQ 


Safe & Effective ? 

Almost a third of Britons who have so far died from the Indian (Delta) Covid had been 💉💉double jabbed, a new report has revealed, with Boris on the verge of delaying 'Freedom Day' by up to 4 week.

It’s time for Plan B 


The WHO continue to cause death, suffering & economic destruction through their suppression of Ivermectin 

(But they are making 💉 investors 💰💰💰💰💰💰billions)

Many at the WHO belong behind bars, for a most the heinous crimes against humanity. 
Another real life example of 🍀Ivermectin saving lives

But a cabal of the compromised (& their useful idiot supporters) continue deny & suppress Ivermectin, all so they can force their experiment genetic agents 💉to be injected into everyone, even children 
Food for thought 🤔

Looks like putting children on a trendy vegan diet makes them grow up shorter & with weaker bones

Researchers found children aged 5 -10 eating plant-based diets are on average 3 centimetres shorter than those who eat meat

‘’HIGHER THAN EXPECTED’’

But with a straight face, they’ll assure you it’s ‘safe’


The world should ‘thank’ the rulers of Tamil Nadu

Just as the rulers of the old East Germany & North Korea taught us of the dangers of totalitarianism 

Tamil Nadu has taught the world the dangers of rejecting Ivermectin

YouTube need to be held criminally liable for their lies & disinformation on Ivermectin.

Sudden hearing loss reported after jab

Only a few BILLION reasons why Merck would trash ivermectin 💰

Merck can ONLY get Emergency Use Authorisation for its new antiviral if there's no other treatment

If ivermectin (a cheap off-patent drug) was accepted, then Merck can't make lots of money 🤔

The Crime of the Century

And YouTube are one of the criminals. 
YouTube’s censorship of the evidence on HCQ & Ivermectin (which protects their parent company’s investments in the 💉) should result in YouTube’s senior management facing jail terms. They have blood on their hands. 
It's DISGUSTING how Comrade Palaszczuk's government is destroying Queensland small businesses & jobs

Say NO to vaccine passports

They create a 'two-tier society' leading to people feeling discriminating against as they will be used to EXCLUDE people from society

Problem is that you can still be infected if you have a vaccine passport #BreakthroughCases

Censored by the criminals at YouTube (with their vested financial interests in the 💉) but available on Bitchute : 



@btysonmd Dr Tyson, this breaks my heart. Don’t stop, keep fighting Get these bastards.

You injected a 15 year Downs Syndrome, Autistic child with your experimental genetic agent. And the child died 3 to 4 days after. 

May you rot in hell.

No. of REPORTED adverse reactions from 💉 in UK between 24 Jan & 2 June;

Pfizer 💉  193,768 
Oxford 💉  717,250

The rate of suffering a serious adverse reaction in 🇬🇧after being injected with an experimental 💉 is 1 in every 142 people, so far.


Well said doctor. 

Any politician that thinks they have the power to ‘’allow’’ or ‘’give permission’’ to free citizens is unfit for office. 
Great news, Texas & Florida’s No Vaccine Passport legislation forces Royal Caribbean to end farcical discriminatory policies.

Young people are not lab rats. 

Prime Minister, end this experiment now ! 


When Big Tech believes they are not only smarter than medical doctors who have devoted their lives to science & saving lives, but censor their opinions, it proves YouTube have accumulated too much unaccountable power & they need to be smashed into pieces



😲Now there’s a surprise ! 
When have we ever heard a single health bureaucrat talk about the importance of Vitamin D ? 

Their conduct is that of those that don’t want anything else, but a needle in every arm. 


Follow the money

💵YouTube are owned by Google
💵Google’s parent company Alphabet own 12% of Vaccitech 
💵Vaccitech own the technology behind AstraZeneca 💉
💵YouTube censor facts on HCQ & Ivermectin because they compete against the 💉 
Why are we not listening to the doctors treating patients on the frontlines - and instead,  listening to out of touch ivory tower health bureaucrats and television actors ? 
Engaging in conduct to deny the sick medicine is a crime against humanity. 

That’s what Fauci and rest of the cabal did. 

"Vaccine passports or certificates" will lead to unlawful discrimination

They will be used to EXCLUDE non-vaccinated groups from access to essential services & employment

Say NO to a 2 tier society

Say NO to DISCRIMINATION

Say NO to VACCINE Passports

The harsh reality for the brainwashed alarmists, is that the data & evidence unambiguously shows, that we’ve never been safer from climatic extremes that have plagued mankind for eternity. 
When this is all over, and the criminals that blocked sick people accessing medicines (HCQ + Zinc + AZ) are rotting in jail cells, we’ll we building statutes to Dr Zelenko and his courage & ingenuity will be taught in every school. 
SIM CARDS DISABLED FOR THOSE WITHOUT VACCINE PASSPORTS

This is where we are headed unless we fight back. 


US "Breakthrough" cases, where you can get still get infected after being FULLY vaccinated, keep GROWING

700 such cases in Dallas County with 11 dying

"Vaccine passports" are USELESS as they're NO guarantee

You can still get infected if you have one !!

Again, when nothing makes sense, just follow the money ....... 
And to complete the loop, Google have investments in Oxford’s Vaccitech, and YouTube (owned by Google) censor criticisms of the 💉 and censors the truth on Ivermectin & HCQ 

And there you have the greatest anti-competitive scam in history. 


And other ‘’Oxford Scientists’’ ran a study on HCQ, excluding zinc and overdosing sick patients with HCQ late into their illness - and then proclaimed to the world HCQ ‘’didn’t work”


And if off patent HCQ or Ivermectin were shown effective, ‘’private investors’’ would have missed out on millions 



💰If HCQ or Ivermectin are deemed effective the 💉 can’t get emergency use approval

💰Vaccitech Inc own the biotechnology behind AstraZeneca 💉

💰Google’s parent company, Alphabet, owns 12% of Vaccitech 

💰YouTube (Google) censor evidence on the effectiveness HCQ & Ivermectin 
Big Brother Bill will save us ??

He doesn't care about the money, he just wants our obedience because he knows best ?? 🤔 

@BloodontheirHands

How many hundreds of thousands of people died, denied access to low cost treatment with Hydroxychloroquine because of Trump derangement syndrome ? 

If you demonised HCQ you have blood on your hands


Censorship of ivermectin has cost millions of lives !!

Big Pharma has done what any anti-competitive business would do to suppress a low cost competitor

Just like Bill Gates tried to do to Microsoft competitors

All to vaccinate the whole world $$

SHAME

Fauci and Facebook spreading disinformation to mislead the world. 


Vaccine passports NO help on cruise ship where EVERYONE onboard had been FULLY vaccinated BUT two passengers tested positive

All guests had been required to show proof of vaccination as well as a negative test taken within 72 hr of departure


So there's growing concern in the US with what are called "breakthrough" cases," that's where people get infected even after being FULLY vaccinated

What happens when "breakthrough" cases start growing in Australia?

"Vaccine passports" will be meaningless 
Report indicates more "breakthrough" cases, where you can still get infected even after being FULLY vaccinated, showing up in vaccinated women

So you & people around you can still get infected

NO point to a "vaccine passport"


So people are STILL tragically dying after being infected even AFTER being fully vaccinated

These "breakthrough" cases mean that "vaccine passports" are MISLEADING & DANGEROUS as people may feel totally safe when they can STILL get infected !!!


I expect to see a conga-line of apologists coming to the Despatch Box in Parliament next week to beg forgiveness for the lives lost due to their ignorance, stupidity and politicising Hydroxychloroquine.

‘’We know masks are effective?” 

Other than the assertions of Lord Fauci - where is the evidence ? 

And why do those that assert that masks are ‘effective’ (with scant evidence) claim Ivermectin is not, despite 50+ studies showing it is ? 

@Hypocrite

At least we now understand the logic behind ‘’double-masking’’ 😷😷🤥🤥 
Science ignored and millions sacrificed for covid politics. That’s the legacy of Lord Fauci.

Where as anyone proposed that half an Asprin given ALONE and not started until 9 days AFTER first symptoms is of any use ? 

Medical malfeasance at its worst.
@Covid19Crusher Somebody call the police. The Oxford boys are back.

This time, their great ‘half-an-Asprin Covid trial’ has left over 2,521 dead. 

I wonder how many might of 2521 dead might have survived if given early treatment with Ivermectin or HCQ + Zinc ? 

How do they sleep at night ?
It's ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING that an elected official could receive death threats for doing his job

Violence has NO PLACE in a democracy & threatening elected officials is CRIMINAL

Just shows how far the left is prepared to go to deflect from Fauci's lies

Someone gets it ...

"Some are still diligently wearing masks. If Fauci terrified these people to the point where they feel safer wearing a mask, despite never having needed one, we have a duty to help them leave irrationality behind by exposing the truth"

Unmasking Fauci on masks !!

A Stanford epidemiologist has said Fauci’s “credibility is entirely shot” after Fauci's conflicting advice on face masks since Feb 2020 — which was criticized as being “all over the place.”

So WRONG of FAUCI to lead us astray

If the Malaysian Health Ministry can start an Ivermectin trial for high-risk patients, why can't health officials around the world do the same?

What are they afraid of ?? That it may work ??

Surely, proving it does or doesn't work should be a priority ??

‘’Something is ABOUT to happen” ?

Keep up crusher, 🧐it already has😱 

🇮🇳INDIA (3% fully 💉) now has LOWER new daily infection rate than 🇬🇧UK (40% fully 💉)

Well that certainly doesn’t fit the narrative !

And I wonder if the ABC or BBC will report these facts ?


The Morrison government should "hang their heads in shame" for even considering vaccine passports for domestic travel, according to Sky News host Rowan Dean.

" ...... coercing them through a passport or a certificate is deeply cynical," he said.


Just imagine how different things could have been if Professors McCullough, Risch & Bhattacharya had of been in charge instead of that C grader, the fraudster Fauci ? 

At least a million lives could have been saved & trillions in economic damage avoided


TIME TO ISSUE THE YELLOW ARMBANDS 

Globalist Tony Blair says it’s ‘’Time to Distinguish’’ between those that have been injected with the experimental biological agent and those who have not.

‘’MORTALITY REDUCED BY 30%”’

Where is the clown show 🤡🤡 of Australia’s CMO’s ? 

Do they think Professor Raoult’s study is mistaken ? 

For how long will they continue to put Australian lives at risk by denying sick Aussies access to HCQ? 
Another urgent job for Dr Ally & Dr Tanya - they need to quickly go online overnight to debunk this latest study by Professor Raoult. 
They lied about almost everything, and they suppressed early treatment with low cost off-patent drugs. 

They have the blood on millions on their hands 



‘’Hugely Discriminatory’’ 

Mighty India 🇮🇳 hold the line on opposing Vaccine Passports 


Dr Benigno Agbayani, President Concerned Doctors & Citizens of the Philippines, said since last year, he’d spent 5 hours + a day studying scientific literature on all things pertaining to COVID. “I think I’ve read more than anyone on COVID’’ he stated.


He’s done his homework 

Bishop Prof. Dr Thomas Schirrmacher PhD, DD, President International Society for Human Rights, Sec-General World Evangelical Alliance (networks churches with 600 million conservative Protestant Christians) endorses IVERMECTIN


The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has been using Ivermectin as both a prophylaxis and treatment. 

I wonder how that’s working out for them ? 
Congratulations to the Indian Bar Association. It’s about time these global bureaucrats were held to account for their crimes against humanity for intentionally suppressing Ivermectin & HCQ.

Their malfeasance has caused over a million unnecessary deaths


EFFECTIVE ? 🤔

In the USA at least 2,200 people ‘’fully💉vaccinated’’ have been admitted to hospital for Covid 🦠 and 447 (20.3%) of them have died from covid. 


The greatest threat to ‘’public safety’’ is Facebook’s censorship policies.

Facebook’s censorship of the truth on HCQ and Ivermectin has contributed to over a million deaths. 

Facebook have blood on their hands. 
That doesn’t seem to fit the narrative 🤔 
When in history and in what parts of the world do armed police turn up to a journalists home in the night to intimidate them ?

Eastern Europe in the 1950’s ?
North Korea ?
Stalin’s Russia ? 
Orwell’s 1984 ? 
Victoria in 2021 ? 

‘’He has not treated patients for over thirty years so when he squelched therapeutics HCQ and ivermectin, he condemned tens of thousands to death.  There was no money to be made from the use of inexpensive drugs that were over fifty years old.’’
‘’Fauci became the wizard of COVID & the media clung to his every word if he were some sort of all-knowing oracle.  

‘’In fact, he just another self-serving bureaucrat with delusions of dominion over us all’’ 


When a man as credentialed and as experienced as Professor Peter McCullough says he can no longer recommend people to be injected with the experimental biological agent 💉 - it’s time to sit up and listen


MAKE TORNADOES GREAT AGAIN 

We need Real Action™️ to stop this climate change. 
Obviously ‘global warming’ is blame for record cold. 


And never forget, our National Covid Evidence Force clown show continues to recommend FOR Remdesivir (patented drug costing $3000 +) but against HCQ (off patent costing a few dollars). 
Why worry about Vaccine ‘Passports’ or ‘Certificates’ for participating in the global 💉 experiment. 

Why not just stamp everyone with a tattoo? 

Surely it would quicker, less costly and more convenient? 
They lied about everything;
🤥Wuhan Lab
🤥Masks
🤥Lockdowns
🤥PCR tests 
🤥Early treatment, HCQ & Ivermectin 

all for the purpose of getting us to submit 🐑 to volunteering for their global experiment of injecting 💉 a biological agent into every arm on the planet. 
But what would he know. 
Some would rather take medical advice from TV stars 🤩🤩 

‘’Never in modern medicine have we ever considered mass vaccination of children with an investigational biologic product with no proven efficacy or safety’’

Yes - but think of the 💰 that can be made from 💉 every child 🤑🤑

Follow the 💰💰

We could have closed out the pandemic with 💊 costing US$0.12 for a 5 day course. But that would’ve scuttled the $100 billion 💉 

And 👀 at the margins for Big Pharma on Ivermectin - no wonder they didn’t want to upset their apple cart. 


They always knew HCQ was effective

It was suppressed, demonised & facts censored, for if they told the truth, $100 billion 💉 industry would have NEVER gotten off the ground

& they had useful idiots like Drs Bowen & Albo to help spread misinformation. 


What would this this bloke know - he’s only a Nobel laureate for medicine. 

And the point he makes, it not only the medium and long term effects we have no idea about - it’s also the inter-generational effects. 
War has been declared. 

A ‘vaccine certificate’ is just another name for a vaccine passport. 

Time to man the barricades. My ‘No Domestic Vaccine Passport Bill’ would prevent this. 


If we were following the data, evidence, science & listening to the real experts - we’d be using Ivermectin as a prophylaxis in nursing homes. 

But it’s not about the evidence or science - it’s all about injecting an experimental agent into every arm

#CrimeoftheCentury 
So Fauci gets email from president of 'EcoHealth Alliance' thanking Fauci “for publicly standing up & stating scientific evidence supports natural origin, not lab release from Wuhan”

Fauci now admits $600,000 sent to Wuhan lab via 'EcoHealth Alliance' 🤔 
So Fauci had 'cozy relationship' with China's top infectious disease expert in early days of pandemic & doesn't ask questions on virus origins

Fauci then spends the next year downplaying Wuhan lab LEAK theory BUT NOW says theory should be investigated 🤔

Looks like Fauci was informed in early 2020 that ‘the virus looks engineered’ with recently released Fauci emails adding fuel to ‘lab-made pandemic’ theories

So we have real possibility virus was engineered & then somehow released & then 'need' for jab 🤔

Just like Mexico and India, Argentina provides another example where states/provinces adopting different policies of Ivermectin, come up with completely different results. 
New study : ‘’use of hydroxychloroquine reduce deaths ... if the US had made HCQ widely fatalities would have been reduced from about 515,000 to 427,000’’

In other words 100,000 Americans died, because they didn’t want to admit that Trump was right.

Congratulations to the Indian State government of Goa. 

They have bravely and correctly called out the malfeasance and corruption of the bureaucrats at the W.H.O for blocking Ivermectin. 

The WHO are causing ill-health and death.


Yet again, superstition & groupthink rule above data & evidence




The data shows that Plexiglass screens haven't been preventing the spread of COVID, and they might even be counterproductive.
If you believe that high rates of injections (with experimental genetic 💉) are the key to stopping surges in covid outbreaks & deaths - you are not following the evidence 


I wonder this tragic death will make some Australian ABC journalists wake up and do some research & independent thinking rather than parrot the lines of Big Pharma & the $100 billion vaccine lobby ? 


If only the 💉💉💉 could be as safe & effective


Don’t be a brainwashed 🐑 
Learn the evidence for Ivermectin

• 97% of 37 early treatment & prophylaxis studies report positive effects (95% of all 56 studies). 26 studies show statistically significant improvement

 
 I’ve been saying this for almost 12 months - and I’ve been mocked, ridiculed & abused by the brainwashed, while over 2.5 million people have died, denied access to a low cost off patent treatment. 


And the numbers of ‘’Fully vaccinated’’ needing hospitalisation for Covid and dying from it, are exploding. 

NB : These deaths don’t include deaths reported from adverse reactions from the 💉 which the US alone number over 4000. 
SAFE & EFFECTIVE ? 

1,758 “Fully Vaccinated” American have been hospitalised due to Covid, and 365 have died due to Covid. 

And these numbers are likely an underestimate. 


Austrian newspaper prints the truth about Ivermectin. 

For how much longer will the Australian media continue to suppress the truth ?

Malfeasance? 

Surely on this data, the benefit outweighs the risks ? 
When the health bureaucrats claim "the benefits of the 💉 outweigh the risks’’ - is that true for people under with no underlying conditions (given they have a 10 times less risk) ? 

I will be asking this question of Health Minister in Parliament. 
A special place in hell awaits the politicians & health bureaucrats that made this bloody minded decision.

France investigating cases of myocarditis–inflammation of heart muscle–detected in those receiving Pfizer jab

Just a coincidence for now, but nevertheless constitutes 'potential signal that needs to be monitored'

STOP DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AUSSIE paralympians

@AUSParalympics FORCING a vaccine mandate on our Paralympians goes AGAINST the advice of the Australian Olympic Committee & International Paralympic Committee, who strongly recommended but did NOT mandate! 
Memo to Facebook and other Big Tech giants, that think they are above the law and get away with censoring people and defaming them - WE ARE COMING AFTER YOU 
Facebook have misled and deceived the world. They have blood on their hands. 

Everyone that Facebook has banned for allegedly posting ‘’misinformation’’ should sue Facebook for defamation and bankrupt the company 


WE ARE BEING PLAYED 

We are being told that a high rate of 💉 reduces the spread of the 🦠

But how can this be, when the world’s most 💉 nation, also has the world’s highest rate of new 🦠 infections ? 

And why won’t the 🇦🇺 media report this fact ?🙈🙊

Bahrain records unprecedented surge in infections DESPITE almost 42% of population being FULLY vaccinated

Shouldn't put all your eggs in the Big Pharma basket 

Might ALSO need a Plan B given "breakthrough" cases where you can get infected after jab

Another sad coincidence with the tragic death of a young man after blood clots following the jab

Your risk, your choice !!


US State of Michigan Senate passed a bill banning state or local health officers from mandating children receive COVID vaccines

Say NO to mandates

Say NO to coercion

Your child, your choice !!

Your risk, your choice !!


Despite UAE’s rapid rollout of its jab program, the country had to radically scale back plans for a speedy exit from lockdown after surge in cases

For those Big Pharma believers the renewed spike in infections took some of the shine off program 
Seychelles & Maldives both have high jab rates but both have seen a surge in cases

Why ?

Big Pharma's solution may not be solving the problem given variants, less than 100% efficacy & "breakthrough" cases where you can still get infected AFTER the jab

Just amazing. An absolute must watch. 

Dr Peter McCullough restores your faith in humanity. 

In decades to come, when those engage in the current medical malfeasance are still rotting in cells, they’ll be erecting a statute to Dr. McCullough. 

Watch : 
Countries with the world’s highest vaccination rates—including 4 of the top 5 most vaccinated—are fighting to contain outbreaks

Why ?

No jab is 100 % effective

Variants ?

"Breakthrough" cases where you can still be infected after being FULLY vaccinated

US State of Tennessee has 908 "breakthrough" cases where people get infected AFTER being FULLY vaccinated, with 82 hospitalised & 14 dying

"Breakthrough" cases mean that we may not stay at Zero & a Plan B is needed for those getting infected after jab

SHAME, ABC, SHAME !!

As those Indian States using Ivermectin continue to diverge in cases and deaths from those states that forbid it, (decreasing where it’s used & increasing where it’s not) the natural experiment illustrates the power of Ivermectin decisively.


We are being told that high rates of injections of the experimental genetic vaccine will help suppress covid outbreaks. 

Then why is the world’s most vaccinated nation experiencing a huge surge in Covid ? 


Health Bureaucrats playing games by suppressing and ignoring the evidence of Ivermectin are on notice. Your malfeasance is criminal. 


Why are we not using Ivermectin now ? 

Why are government health bureaucrats continuing to deny the evidence ? 

Is it because they want to stick a 💉 in every arm and don’t care how many die, denied Ivermectin ?

Latest IVERMECTIN study just published funds even a single dose is highly effective. 




And no surprises here, totally consistent with 50+ other published studies. 

Yet Australian bureaucrats continue to deny the evidence and push the 💰💉 
Dr Chandrashekhar on IVERMECTIN: ‘’There is enough evidence to show the effectiveness of the drug’’

But Dr Ally & Dr Tanya giggle at this suggestion, and it’s use continues to be denied and suppressed in Australia - putting the nation in grave peril

Stephanie Dubois, 39, suffered a “serious thrombotic episode” after being given the jab

Health officials said that she had no underlying health conditions.


Paralympics Australia's vaccine mandate on Paralympians is DISCRIMINATORY as AOC's John Coates has said it's NOT mandatory for Aussie Olympians

It's 'not compulsory, we can't do that' Mr Coates has reportedly said

STOP THE DISCRIMINATION OF PARALYMPIANS

This is very clever ....... 🤣🤣🤣


This one of the most blatant frauds since the Fine Cotton affair 
Fraud & deception used by the medical mafia to try & discredit Ivermectin

What a disgrace

They cherry-picked a few studies, then switched the numbers around from Niaee study, so they showed exact opposite of what the study found - & then lied to claim Ivermectin doesn’t work 
IVERMECTIN continues to crush covid in the Indian State of Goa. 

Question : Why are we not using it here to protect Australians ? 

Answer : they want to sell you the jab 💉 
2550 "Breakthrough" cases reported  in US State of Minnesota - where FULLY vaccinated people still get infected with 239 being hospitalised & 26 dying

"Breakthrough" cases mean vaccine passports are USELESS as a person could be infected even after the jab

Miranda Devine wrote this back on the 12 Aug 2020

We knew Ivermectin worked then 

But the truth was suppressed as they wanted to sell the vaccines. 

Since then over 2.5 million people have died of Covid

Ivermectin denial & suppression is one of the worst crimes in history

Show me your papers ! 

"Breakthrough" cases where you can get infected even after being FULLY vaccinated are troubling because of variants emerging or less than 100% efficacy

So you AND the person next to you could be infected even though FULLY vaccinated

Mandatory masking of children is child abuse.

Professor Dolores Cahill, Immunologist & Molecular Biologist, a renown expert in immunology and the study of immune systems from the University College Dublin.

Geert Vanden Bossche, DMV, PhD : ‘’mass vaccination with leaky Covid-19 vaccines in the midst of the pandemic can only breed highly infectious variants’’


Minister for Health Andrew Little announced the amendment to the Medicines Act the day of the ruling. 

He added that the Pfizer vaccine did not need rigorous testing and approval because of the critical need for the vaccine during the pandemic. 🤯🤯
‘’Compelling patients or workers to receive a vaccine which is still investigational would set a significant medical precedent, which would run counter to all international codes of medical ethics since the Nuremberg Code of 1947 and Declaration of Helsinki in 1952’’
The letter also argued that encouraging citizens to have the jab in light of its unproven safety was unethical.
“Nobody currently knows how safe or effective this novel mRNA technology is in the medium to long term,” the letter stated. “Highly credible medical experts around the world, and even some vaccine developers themselves, are predicting problems & raising urgent red-flag concerns’’
Last month, KTI released an open letter signed by 43 New Zealand medical practitioners outlining the case and expressed concern over the promotion of the vaccine despite a lack of evidence demonstrating its safety.
The clinical trial for the vax is not due to be completed until April 2023 - it’s a grand medical experiment 

The NZ Medicines Act only allows an experimental vaccine for a ‘limited number of patients’ - but they want to stick a needle in every arm

If ‘’fully vaccinated’’ people are coming into Australia and testing positive, aren’t ‘Vaccine Passports’ useless, if not dangerous misleading ?


South Korea confirms first  'breakthrough' case - where person gets infected after being FULLY vaccinated

Makes vaccine passports USELESS as a person next to you could be infected even though they have been FULLY vaccinated

Say NO to vaccine passports !!

French virologist & Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier called MASS VACCINATION during the pandemic ‘unthinkable’ a ‘historical blunder’

“It’s an enormous mistake, a scientific error as well as a medical error’

But can we debate this without censorship ?


More US "breakthrough" cases where you can still get infected AFTER being FULLY vaccinated mean that vaccine passports are NO guarantee that person next to you is not infected

Vaccine passports are USELESS

Say NO to vaccine passports !!!



"Breakthrough" cases-where you can STILL get infected after being FULLY vaccinated- mean that vaccine passports are USELESS

A person with a vaccine passport could be allowed to travel AND still be infected

Vaccine passports give a FALSE sense of security

Dallas County health officials in the US say they have had more than 500 "breakthrough" cases where fully vaccinated people have been infected with 8 of those people having died

"Breakthrough" cases keep climbing in US making vaccine passports USELESS !!!

You have to wonder when you compare the US with Mexico

US has much higher vaccination rate than Mexico, but now Mexico has slightly lower fatality rate 🤔

Surely, all those Health Officials backing Big Pharma haven't got it WRONG ?? 
Seychelles - the most vaccinated country - is seeing a surge in "breakthrough" cases where FULLY vaccinated people are still getting infected

Such "breakthrough" cases make vaccine passports USELESS !!

"Breakthrough" cases mean you can get infected after being FULLY vaccinated

‘’Something has gone off the rails’’

There should be a criminal inquiry to find out why doctors in Queensland were (& continue to) face 6 months in jail for trying to cure sick people with HCQ

All 29 early treatment studies show HCQ effective 

Watch : 
Fully vaccinated person in hospital  after getting infected-another "breakthrough" case

But Doctors say such cases are 'rare'

The 'rare' word again

"Breakthrough" cases DO occur making vaccine passports USELESS as you can STILL be infected after the jab

And the blood clots & coincidences sadly continue 

Regulators identify another 6 blood clot cases

'Rare' is transitioning to 'not unexpected'

Each blood clot relates to a PERSON & it would be heartless to dismiss the risk !!

Your risk, your choice !!

Domestic Vaccine Passports : ‘’Absolutely against Liberal Party philosophy’’


China tricked the world on solar panels

Vaccine passport are USELESS as they're NO guarantee you're not infected given "breakthrough" cases- where you can get infected after jab 
And to think, Australia’s grossly incompetent National Covid Evidence Taskforce recommends Remdesivir (at thousands of $ a dose), yet recommends against Ivermectin.

Florida Governor DeSantis shows how a real conservative leader tackles calls for domestic ‘’vaccine passports’’. 



‘’It is surely the definition of stupidity and/or sinister intent that our governments ban successful, proven safe treatments at the same time as threatening our lives and livelihoods unless we take drugs that have yet to be proven completely safe.’’
‘’On top of which, there are currently proven medical treatments that Australia should be allowing GPs to prescribe to individuals who so desire, such as ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and others’’ .....
It is a fine line between encouraging/incentivising vaccination & coercing it, but telling traumatised Aussies that they can, for example, only visit their loved ones or carry on their normal business if they inject a certain drug is completely unacceptable & indeed reprehensible
‘’the government has no moral, ethical or, arguably, no constitutional right to limit individual freedoms based on medical intervention’’
‘’This is for one simple reason: governments and bureaucracies have no right to enforce or to coerce an individual to take a medical treatment or drug against the individual’s better instincts or judgment’’
‘’Make no mistake; a ‘vaccine passport’ denying liberties & restricting the free movement of Australians within their own country will be potentially the most sinister & disgraceful act by an Australian government against its own people in our history’’ .........
Any number of conventions and laws exist that make it a criminal offence for a government or its bureaucrats to coerce or make mandatory any form of medical treatment against the will of the individual ......
‘’If the PM, Hunt or any members of federal/national Cabinets seek to impose a ‘vaccine passport’ that restricts freedom of movement & liberties of Australians, they will potentially be guilty of human rights abuses & even crimes against humanity’’


NO DOMESTIC VACCINE PASSPORT

‘’Singapore health officials said that of 28 airport workers who became infected, 19 were FULLY VACCINATED  with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines’’
NO !! 

Domestic Vaccination Passports are NOT the ‘’key to greater freedom’’. 

They are the key to OPPRESSION and tyranny and the destruction of freedoms.

I will oppose them at every turn, & introduce a No Domestic Vaccine Passport Bill into Parliament 

So if you can get it after being FULLY vaccinated doesn't that mean there will always be "breakthrough" cases of the infection around ?

If people can get infected even after the jab, then how can you have vaccine passports ?

Say NO to vaccine passports ! 
NO !! 

Domestic Vaccine Passport are a marketing gimmick of big Pharma, not to mention unconstitutional and contrary to what used to be Liberal Party philosophy

I will be moving the No Domestic Vaccine Passport Bill in Parliament to try & stop this


Growing number of Americans are dealing with the troubling experience of being infected after the jab

These "Breakthrough" cases mean that any Aussie government strategy of zero cases is not realistic in future

People can still get it after the jab 🤔

No one ‘’HAS TO DIE’’ if you just follow the science & listen to the Doctors (not the government bureaucrats) & use Ivermectin as a prophylaxis, and HCQ/Zinc/Doxycycline (plus others) as earlier treatment


WHAT’S THE POINT OF VACCINE PASSPORTS ? 

US state of Minnesota (population 5.6 million) : 1,942 people so far have tested positive for Covid after being ‘’fully vaccinated’’ of which 175 needed hospitalisation and 21 died. 


Then what’s the point of Vaccine Passports ? 

Doesn’t this demonstrate that Vaccine Passports are nothing more than marketing gimmicks ? 


Well then stockpile the Ivermectin, the HCQ, the Quercetin, the Zinc, the Vitamin D, the Budesonside the Fluvoxamine and the povidone Iodine.

The GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines & Immunisation) - a global health partnership of public & private sector organizations dedicated to “immunisation for all” - is a WHO donor

Might not be a fan of ivermectin 🤔

Who funds WHO ?

At a time when there's a stubborn refusal to consider ivermectin you have to wonder why

The World Health Organisation has been at the forefront of recommending against ivermectin

Does it have anything to do with who funds WHO ?? 🤔 
For a vaccine rollout under Emergency Use to be legal, “there must be no adequate, approved & available alternative to candidate product for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease”

Obviously no connection with the suppression of ivermectin ?? 🤔 
30% of speciality Covid beds in Delhi now empty

What if that decision is COSTING LIVES or has cost lives ? 
Ivermectin might be making a difference in Goa, but it's still been ignored by world health officials

You would think in a crisis situation you would try anything under medical supervision like in Goa, BUT NO, world health official STUBBORNLY stick with just one option !!

SHAME 
Ivermectin producing great results in Mexico

Denial of medical treatment is a crime against humanity

Continued refusal to even consider ivermectin is so WRONG & costing lives

All because the medical mafia is fixated on the one option that makes them lots of money !

SHAME !!! 
Son ‘dearly regrets’ telling his mother to get AstraZeneca jab after his mum tragically dies following the jab

Ivermectin for COVID-19.

Early treatment - 79% improvement, p &lt; 0.0001.
All studies - 73% improvement, p &lt; 0.0001.

1 in 23 trillion probability results of the 55 studies are from an ineffective treatment (p = 4.3e-14).

 

• 100% of 36 early treatment and prophylaxis studies report positive effects (96% of all 55 studies). 26 studies show statistically significant improvements in isolation.

• Random effects meta-analys 
Health Minister Vishwajit Rane, India state of Goa : We are giving this as a prophylaxis treatment, as a preventive. Ivermectin tablets will be given to all patients above 18 years’’

Good to see a Health Minister follow the science & evidence, not incompetent health bureaucrats 

@PierreKory @Covid19Critical More support from downunder Dr. Kory - keep fighting sir !!  

@Covid19Crusher @TuckerCarlson @PierreKory You’ve already got Jones + Kelly from downunder 
And down she goes. 

What a surprise, the graph rolls over and starts to fall shortly after several more Indian states approved the widespread use of Ivermectin as a prophylaxis. 
Ivermectin is suppressed, because the truth of its effectiveness would makes the vaccine rollout illegal, and the💉 pushers would miss out on a $100 billion pay day. 


Do you remember the days when the media used to report the truth?




Unlike today, when we are told lies and the truth is censored, all to scare us into lining up like 🐑 for the 💉 multiple times 
With the evidence to hand, any health bureaucrat continuing to  deny and suppress Ivermectin as a treatment for Covid should be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity. 


2021 is the new 1984.

Big Tech have become the ‘Ministry of Truth’, fascist organisations, violating the very principles of free speech that enabled their owners to become rich beyond their dreams

We must fight back against Big Tech’s lies & censorship 
Government health bureaucrats have a lot of questions to answer 


Another example of the criminal suppression of Ivermectin; the publishing of this study showing it works was held up for 7 months after the results were in

In those 7 months, more than 2 people died of covid

For nothing is to interfere the 💉💰💉💰


Another peer-reviewed randomised control study showing Ivermectin works. 




If you are still denying or suppressing Ivermectin, you are engaging in a crime against humanity, you have blood on your hands, and you belong in a prison cell.

But that’s the entire idea of the elites the climate cultists - make private motor vehicle too expensive. 

Those wanting to conduct medical experiments on children and inject them with novel, experimental genetic vaccines are psychopaths. 
Question remains as to whether “vaccine breakthrough” cases- where you get COVID after the jab- can be explained by the varying efficacy rates of the jabs, none of which are 100% effective

Or whether new strains have become more resistant to existing jabs 
Another SEVEN blood clot cases in Australia linked to AstraZeneca

More & more blood clot cases here & around the world, but still Aussie Health Officials STUBBORNLY stick with AZ

Obviously, Aussie Officials are infallible & those elsewhere are wrong 🤔

Canadian Province of Nova Scotia has become 3rd Province to suspend the use of AstraZeneca as first dose

Aussie Health Officials are still saying it's 'safe & effective' BUT a growing number of other places are SUSPENDING it

Officials in Ontario said recent data showed the incidence of the blood-clot syndrome shifted from one for every 100,000 people vaccinated with AstraZeneca to one for every 59,000 people vaccinated with the shot.
Ontario, Canada suspends AstraZeneca.

It’s all one big experiment, they are still unsure what the extend of the short term adverse effects are - and it’s guess work what the medium & long term adverse effects will be. 


Any discrimination is wrong !!

Slovakia has suspended the use of AstraZeneca for those receiving their first dose after an inquiry into the death of a person who suffered blood clots after getting the jab

So AstraZeneca is on the way out in Europe with EU not buying any more vaccines from AZ beyond June

@katelhunter With respect, the data shows the exact opposite of your assertion. Their case fatality rate is increasing, which means a greater percentage are getting sick and dying. 
Interesting results from the grand 💉 experiment. Somehow, it’s the exact opposite what the experts foretold. 
WOW !! What's going on here !!!

Maldives & Seychelles are RUSHING to get everyone vaccinated BUT now they have the HIGHEST NEW cases per capita

You have to ask if the rush is really worth it !!!

Your risk, your choice ! 
The death knell for International Vaccine Passports ?

Over 1/3 of the Seychelles active cases are of people that have had two shots of the 💉

Therefore, what’s the point of any International 💉 passport - because on this data, it would be meaningless


Are you still an Ivermectin denier ? 

Don’t stress, as there’s still a one in 167 trillion chance you are right - and if so, you haven’t aided or abetted crimes against humanity by denying sick people an effective medicine. 


Another Ivermectin study for the genetic 💉 lobby & their useful idiot supporters to try and suppress. 

This study found using Ivermectin as a prophylaxis (an alternative to genetic 💉) reduced infections by 74% - without a single case of blood clots. 


Victoriastan is going to ban gas cook-tops to stop bad weather, end droughts & floods. 

A demented cult was taken control of the state once known as Victoria. 


Trump/Owens 2024 ? 


BREAKING NEWS

Three Senators in the US State of Pennsylvania are introducing legislation that would BAN the state from requiring vaccine passports

The move comes after privacy concerns & the danger they can entrench discrimination


So according to Aussie health officials five more cases of a 'rare blood clotting syndrome' are linked to the AstraZeneca jab, but there's nothing to worry about ...

Of course, unless you're the person with the clots after a jab 🤔

Your risk, your choice

If they were flogging used cars, the ACCC would be coming down on them like a tonne of bricks for misleading or deceptive conduct. 





Zimbabwe is being reported as completely managing its crisis in literally a month

I wonder how ?? 🤔

It's amazing how a small nation can be so proudly opened minded & save lives when others just completely refuse to move from their one option fits all !!

A legislative BAN on vaccine passports is coming in the US State of Texas

We need a legislative BAN here on vaccine passports as they can't be used to exclude you from sporting, hospitality & entertainment venues just for exercising your freedom of choice

If you are going to volunteer to participate in the grand experiment, 💉🐁💉, at least make sure you know what ‘Antibody-dependant Enhancement’ is. 


MORE BREAKING NEWS

Australia records FIVE NEW blood clotting cases after getting the AstraZeneca jab

More sad coincidences, but Aussie Health Officials still adamant that it's "safe and effective"

Your risk, your choice !!


BREAKING NEWS

Tasmanian man, 70, has been hospitalised with suspected blood clotting after getting AstraZeneca jab

Thankfully the man, who reported symptoms 7 days after the jab, is stable

Just another sad coincidence

Your risk, your choice !!

Any Defence Chief of a western democracy, that calls for a ‘Net-Zero’ airforce, while China & Russia are paying lip service to Net-Zero, should stand aside. 

Net Zero stupidity imperils the freedoms of future generations. 


Everything about ‘NET ZERO’ cedes an economic, political & military advantage to the Communist Chinese and imperils future generations’ freedoms.

Any politician appeasing this nonsense & weakening our defence forces, is a traitor to their nation. 


The first job of the Air Chief Marshal is to ensure that the UK has the best aircraft to defend their island home. 

To be so woke and appease the climate cultists with ‘Net zero’ fighter aircraft, imperils the western alliance & is a betrayal of the heritage of the RAF.
RAF Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston; 

‘’The imperative is clear: our politicians will demand it of us, are demanding of us. Our public demands it of us. The young people in the Royal Air Force today demand it of me & the leadership, that we should be taking a lead in this.”
RAF PUSH TO HIT NET ZERO BY 2040 😥

The world has gone mad. If any nation was to understand the vital importance of their airforce, it should be the UK. 

It’s a betrayal the WW2 fighter pilots legacy. 


Stay safe everyone with local flooding expected

And a big thank you to all the great volunteers @NSWSES 
You actually have to feel sorry for someone that is so nasty, vile & ignorant - unable to debate any issue on the facts. 

But sadly, this is typical of those that deny Ivermectin, & are happy to cede economic, political & military strength to China, so they can feel virtuous. 
Ivermectin saves lives. 

Ivermectin suppression & denial kills ☠️

With 52 out of 53 published studies showing Ivermectin effective, to engage in conduct that in anyway prevents the sick from accessing the medicine, is a crime against humanity.


And look what has happened the case fatality rate (ratio deaths/cases) in Seychelles, the most vaccinated place in the world since the vaccination roll out started ....  safe & effective ? 
Oops 😱. The Seychelles is the most vaccinated place in the world. 

But their Covid cases per million are spiraling upwards, way faster in India. 

Why not ban people returning from there ? 
You won’t see this in the mainstream media, because they have an agenda to run a fear campaign. 
The US State of Iowa is just a Governor's signature away from a legislative BAN on vaccine passports

We need a legislative BAN on vaccine passports in Australia to STOP Aussies being discriminated against for exercising their freedom of choice


What's this? 

Comrade Dan's government REFUSING to publicly release vital information about their stuff ups during the pandemic

So typical of the nasty, self entitled Left

They do what they want & then cover up their MISTAKES !!


Looks like there are no guarantees even where a country pushes everyone to get it 

Just imagine where a country goes to all the effort of getting as many people to get it & then there is still a surging number of cases !!


24/Processes of suppressing academic deliberation, eliminating all disagreements, doubts, & scientific controversy, such as those we are witnessing are taking place around us these days, are typical of dark regimes and power-to-fascist tendencies contrary to human welfare
Don't you just love innovation !!

An Estonian-invented nasal spray has been given the go-ahead 

You just never know, there might be more than one way to deal with the problem !!


Because ‘f’ is for fascism. 

FaceBook = Fascism 
23/ We citizens should therefore be wary of the consensus and its mouthpieces, especially when we see them coming. Then, we must also use a degree of skepticism ....
22/ (the spiral of silence) poses a real danger to society and democracy, as the suppression of other voices, whether of the general public or of scientists, could make the distorted and invented or fabricated reality into a real reality.
21/ when the media aligns with the fictitious consensus dictated to them,this leads to a distortion of the distribution of opinions in society, & so the number of those who refrain from supporting an incompatible opinion increases & a SPIRAL OF EVER-EXPANDING SILENCE IS CREATED
20/ Since most persons do not want to be an exception, they will choose to remain silent or straighten a line and express an opinion that is consistent with what they perceive as the majority opinion ...
19/ The prevailing tendency of most people is to match their expressed opinions to what they perceived as acceptable & agreed upon by the public. Individuals, who estimate that their opinion is different from the majority opinion, will usually refrain from expressing it in public
18/ According to the theory, which has been demonstrated in many studies, most people are anxious about a state of social and ideological isolation and are afraid to express themselves in an ideologically hostile environment ...
17/ The powerful ability of the media to create a simulated dictated consensus has been well described in the theory of THE SPIRAL OF SILENCE known in the academic literature in the field of communication ...
16/The vast majority of the media channels abandoned their traditional role defending democracy and even aligned themselves with the pseudo-consensus dictated from above, which is unscientific by virtue of being dictated ....
15/  This, using the improper means mentioned above of ridiculing, silencing, and suppressing any attempt to express an opposing opinion or one that casts doubt on the official position. ....
14/ One of the measures taken by the authorities since the beginning of the corona crisis is a sweeping takeover of public discourse and the creation of a false representation of a scientific consensus. 

This, using the improper means mentioned above of ridiculing, silencing ...
13/ The mainstream media now serving as spokespersons for these interested parties without examining things in depth as is required of journalists in democratic & free countries. 

This is a dangerous phenomenon that is a slippery slope .....
12/ These silencing &repression moves have many partners, & are driven by powerful groups with economic &  political interests, which support each other in order to continue to control the current agenda – governments, health authorities, (big Pharma) and the mainstream media..
11/ This phenomenon of suppressing and silencing of doctors, whose positions are contrary to those of the establishment ....is no doubt that it is gaining momentum and worsening today ....
10/ Doctors, who expressed a critical stance regarding the vaccine & / or the coercion policy and the green passport outline, received warning letters from the ministry of health and some were even targets of defamation campaigns in the media

This phenomenon of suppressing ...
9/Like a virus that takes over a cell and makes it as its own until completely destroying it, so politics invaded the sanctity of the medical system and infiltrated it with a means of intimidation, paralysis of medical discretion, and silencing scientific discourse ...
8/In their propaganda to encourage vaccination, the health system officials in charge of the public safety sadly have appeared more than once as salespeople trying their best to pitch their products, while exaggerating their advantages and intentionally hiding their downsides ..
7/  as part of the aggressive propaganda to encourage the Israeli public to vaccinate against the coronavirus, senior officials of the ministry of health declare firmly that the vaccine is safe and risk free, while knowing it is IMPOSSIBLE to evaluate its (full) safety .....
6/The (novel & experimental) Pfizer COVID vaccine was given to the Israeli citizens without receiving their informed consent & without giving them information about the vaccine's safety, potential risks, possible side effects, expected efficiency, & MEDICAL ALTERNATIVES ......
5/Is it possible that the state leaders of Israel suffer from an uncontrollable impulse to vaccinate the entire population, which arises from their need to be portrayed as the saviors of the people ......

(Sounds familiar)
4/In psychology, an ‘impulse control disorder’ is defined as an unstoppable inner need of a person to perform a certain action even knowing it may harm oneself or others. ...
3/After analyzing the preliminary findings .... we believe there is reason for concern that the multitude of wrongs brought upon the Israeli public during the COVID vac. campaign may be the consequence of a disorder known in psychology as "impulse control disorder’’ ....
2/Based on the information we have gathered from the public & many other sources, we were exposed to a wide range of severe wrongs caused to the public since the COVID vaccination campaign in Israel began. These wrongs are spread across all areas of life & are characterized ...
Worth a read .. 

1/ The Israeli People’s Committee is an independent and apolitical group of Israeli citizens, who vary in their worldviews and areas of expertise. Among us there are physicians, lawyers, scientists & researchers ..... 



@Kenneth72712993 Love your work - I hope you don’t mind me sharing, and cutting & pasting occasionally


‘Glacier Retreat’ is often used by Alarmists to brainwash gullible & naive children into their cult.

But THE SCIENCE evidences a cyclical pattern unrelated to C02. 

Growth in the 1960’s & 70’s

Greatest retreats occurred back in the 1930s & 1940s, with a deceleration since. 

😱😱😱 It’s time to panic !!

Who cares if we cede economic, political & military strength to the Communist Chinese - as long as we get to virtue signal about the illusion of ‘taking action on climate change’™️ 
What has the world come to when a teacher tells a MUM what to feed her child ?

BREAKING NEWS

Looks like a legal challenge to the ban on Aussie Citizens trying to get back from India has been LAUNCHED in the Federal Court 

The ban with the threat of jail terms for AUSSIE CITIZENS is just plainly WRONG 
Trying to jail CITIZENS for trying to come home is WRONG & deserves to be declared illegal by the Courts ASAP

It could happen to anyone of us who proudly call themselves Aussie citizens

The Government has an obligation to get every citizen back safely !!

Looking for a mid week holiday in the Royal National Park in my Hughes electorate

Some great accommodation deals available 👍


Indigenous leader Warren Mundine is RIGHT when he says we should be telling all our kids - no matter who they are - they have the "opportunities" in life to get wherever they want to & shouldn't be categorised as either "evil" or a "victim"

WELL SAID !!

Sounds like they’d hoped that in those 3 days her condition would deteriorate to such an extend that she’d die irrespective of what treatment she received. 

Denying sick people medicine is a crime against humanity - but it’s what Ivermectin deniers do daily. 
2021  = 1984 
‘’He who controls the present controls the past’’

The Inconvenient facts of the US historical wild-fire data have been sent down a memory hole, as they make a mockery of claims of that we have climate emergency.

A top Western Australian doctor has raised serious concerns regarding WA hotel quarantine 

And if you're going to require a mask make sure they're appropriate in a quarantine situation

There are plenty of reasons to end the Chinese lease on the Port of Darwin NOW

&gt;China has set on an aggressive course to dominate the Indo-Pacific region
&gt;the Port of Darwin's strategic location in the region
&gt;it's critical to the defence of Australia


The cooling continues. 🥶

Average global temperatures have fallen by over 0.5°C since the start of 2020. 
Looks like the ‘trapped heat’ has escaped.

But there’s still an urgent need to cede economic, political & military power to the Communist Chinese to stop this type of warming🤯🤯🤯


Big Pharma making lots of money from the jab VS waiving their intellectual property rights

Pressure is mounting on Biden to back a waiver of COVID jab patents held by Big Pharma

What a dilemma for the lefties🤔

Was it all about the money for Big Pharma?

Let's make it NINE members of the Federal parliamentary crossbench demanding the government drop its jail threats to Australian CITIZENS in India wanting to come back, and bring them & other stranded Australians home safely

Aussie citizens have RIGHTS !!!

Another US State joins in banning vaccine passports

Arkansas Governor signs law BANNING vaccine passports 

We need to ban them here NOW !!!


More & more of our freedoms have been undermined or taken away under the guise of COVID, you have to wonder if this is illegal or constitutionally invalid

There are serious legal doubts about trying to jail Aussie citizens under the Biosecurity Act !!

I stand with stranded Aussies

Leaders need to show compassion & not play politics with Aussies stranded overseas

Aussies have valid reasons to travel & wherever possible Governments should help, NOT jail them

We need a plan NOW to get them back safely !

For constituents of mine who live in Jannali or surrounding suburbs


For my constituents who may have an overdue library book or 3 from our local Sutherland Shire Libraries

#DoTheRightThing 
Surely the Biosecurity Act wouldn't be used for 'political purposes' ??

Threatening to jail AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS just for trying to come HOME to AUSTRALIA is WRONG and can NEVER be justified

AUSSIE CITIZENS are legally entitled to come home !!!


And a very worthy winner he’d be.

Cause and effect ? 
Jail terms for AUSSIE citizens trying to return to AUSTRALIA is just DISGUSTING

Just imagine if it was you overseas

All because our Federal & State governments have not got their act together on hotel quarantine !!
It's just DISGRACEFUL that families have to keep going to court to have access to potentially life saving medical treatments

Great to see the courts doing the right thing !!

SHAME on all those deniers who are putting lives at RISK 
One is reminded of the old saying 'Better to be safe then sorry'

Your risk, your choice !!

I'm sure the Chinese owner will understand & cooperate with handing back the Port of Darwin ASAP given Aussies would not be allowed to buy a Chinese Port 
What do we have here ? 

Tech Giants paying minimal tax on earnings generated from Australian subscribers

Being good corporate citizens I see ?? 🤔

Time for a crackdown on Tech Giants thinking they can get away with paying minimal tax here !!


Wage theft or underpaying employees is WRONG 

The Federal Government MUST strengthen laws to crackdown on unconscionable employers who underpay staff

We need increased penalties for underpaying workers & make it easier for staff to reclaim stolen wages

There are plenty of reasons why we MUST BAN vaccine passports

&gt;potential breaches of privacy regarding sensitive personal health info
&gt;lack of remedies if privacy is breached
&gt;embedding discrimination of those with legitimate reasons for not getting it 
Compassion in actions not just words !

We've locked out Aussie CITIZENS & made it ILLEGAL for those in India to get back

All because Governments here can't get their act together on quarantine

How about some empathy from our leaders for stranded Aussies 
US State of Alabama progressing a bill that would prevent public & private agencies from denying services to individuals based on their vaccination status

I'm committed to moving a bill here to BAN vaccine passports across Australia

I'll be moving the same Bill here

A Legal Ban on Aussie CITIZENS coming HOME sets a very dangerous precedent on so many levels

&gt;a breach of fundamental legal rights of citizens
&gt;a denial of human rights
&gt;lack of compassion & empathy for those Aussies overseas for legitimate reasons

We MUST always call out publicly China’s acts of aggression

Acts of aggression, or acts that undermine or threaten our National Security are just UNACCEPTABLE !!


The vested interests are terrified, they know Ivermectin works, but if they save this women’s life, they demonstrate suppression & denial of the evidence was a crime against humanity

Withholding medicine to dying people = Crimes Against Humanity.

STOP invading our privacy !!!


We need ACTION NOW to get stranded AUSSIES back from India or anywhere else because of COVID

Just imagine if you were stranded overseas in a danger zone, you would expect your Government to help you leave the danger zone NOT prevent you from doing so !!


Not good enough !!

The NSW State Liberal Government must fix this NOW

Don't put my constituents at risk !!

I stand with frontline health workers 
Still think that Hydroxychloroquine is an ineffective treatment ? 

Take comfort in that there’s still one in a billion chance you are right. 


In the first 3 months of this year;

82% of 🇨🇳 ⬆️ in electricity production came from fossil fuels.

🇨🇳 produced an ⬆️ 250.5 TWh of electricity from fossil fuels - in comparison, over the same time 🇦🇺 National energy market produced in TOTAL around 50 TWh 
Signing 🇦🇺 to Net Zero by 2050 (while China ‘promises’ to do it by 2060) cedes economic, political and military power to the Chinese Communists and rightly should be considered and act treason. 
Imagine being so indoctrination and brainwashed, that your mind tells you that this is what catastrophic global warming look likes. 🤯


Do you remember the global cooling scare of the 1970’s ? 
Yes, but there’s been some warming if we cherry-pick 1979 as the starting point. 

 
 Why the discrimination against India ? 
 What a money making opportunity 💰💰

The government forces every person to buy your product (multiple times) No product liability to worry about, and your payments are all government guaranteed. 


Why are they not using Ivermectin? 

It’s almost as though they don’t want to fix the problem. 


Federal Government needs to tell us what's the plan to get AUSSIE CITIZENS back NOW from India & anywhere else they're in danger from COVID

We can't ABANDON Aussie citizens !!

We need to evacuate them URGENTLY as we would if there was a natural disaster

Aussie CITIZENS in India are being prevented by force of law from returning home & the lefties, including Labor, are SILENT

What HYPOCRITES !!

They're the first to open borders to anyone, but are silent when the borders are closed to AUSSIES in  DANGER overseas

#AussiesHomeNow
How can anyone in good conscience abandon Aussies in India or anywhere

If they had been in a natural disaster, we would've done anything to get them back

We're forcing Aussies to stay in a danger zone, because we can't manage them in hotel quarantine ??
Global Warming Update 🥶

Wake, you are being played by UN Globalists, Green Rent-Seekers and the Communist Chinese. 


Bloody Global Warming !! 🔥🔥

We need Real Action™️ to stop this dangerous warming, even if it means surrendering our sovereignty to UN Globalists, and our industries to the Communist Chinese. 
So the WHOLE world needs to get it BEFORE the borders reopen

It's voluntary but you can't go anywhere until you get it

It's OUTRAGEOUS to strip our freedoms until Big Pharma can give it to everyone

That's why we need to have a debate about alternatives

Because we follow the evidence.


There are vested interests that don’t want you to consider Professor Raoult’s views and want them censored. 


It's WRONG on so many levels to try to legally stop Australian CITIZENS from returning HOME

You can't jail them for trying to get home

Aussies stuck overseas through NO fault of their own have a RIGHT to expect the Government to help them get back !!

It's voluntary but if you don't take it we'll limit your freedoms

No mention of possible other treatments under medical supervision

No mention of possible blood clots

No mention of possible death

Just do what you're told or we'll cancel you

SO WRONG !

STOP the lefty lunacy in our Schools

The national curriculum must NOT divide us

It must recognise that we're ALL Aussies first & foremost

No place for lefty ideology that excludes anyone who disagrees with the group think

DEBATE NOT CENSORSHIP !

Anyone want a bet ? 
To those that have suppressed & denied Ivermectin, HCQ, Zinc & Vit D - because of; financial gain, groupthink, political bias, ignorance or stupidity -  this is your legacy, the crime that history will remember you by. 

 
 Confirmed - increasing CO2 causes global warming ! 

But if it’s only 0.5°C for a doubling to 0.076% - we are better off ! 
At the very time the world needed the ‘contest of ideas’ that only free speech can deliver - instead we follow the Stalinist/Fascist mistakes of the past & adopted censorship/groupthink.

DEBATE NOT CENSORSHIP !! 
Of course the National Curriculum needs to be BALANCED

Less lefty propaganda & more balance

More debate on the spectrum of ideas & less censorship

The great mask fallacy. Another great video exposing how the public have been conned - all designed to create fear. 


Why the war on ivermectin?

Could health agencies be "captured" by corporations who oppose it?

Opposed by those who see it stopping them cashing in on the pandemic?

Social & mass media looking for ad revenue from those who oppose it?

But I hope they make an injectable version available as well for those that prefer a 🥊

Remember when the Muppet Chris Bowen moved a motion in the Australian Federal Parliament attacking doctors that recommended Hydroxychloroquine? 

I wonder if he will apologise for hid dangerous ignorance and groupthink ? 
In early April, many European nations incl. Germany banned AstraZeneca for under 60’s. In Belgium it was under 56

But our health bureaucrats knew better. They said it was ‘safe’ for ages 50-59. Now a 55 year old Aussie jabbed with the stuff is dead. 


The dangers of hotel quarantine!!

The Federal Government must take a leadership role on purpose built quarantine facilities NOW

#savinglives 
Two more tragic coincidences

Our thoughts are with the family & friends

The Therapeutic Drugs Administration (TGA) is working to understand the reason behind both cases but say no link has been established to the jab

#KnowTheRisks #InformedChoice 


A medical report has found that adverse events from the AZ jab occurred more in women & younger people among healthcare workers in Korea

#KnowTheRisks 


Israel's Health Ministry has said it's looking into a small number of reported cases of heart inflammation in people after receiving the Pfizer jab

Could be just coincidence 🤔

Our officials say it's "safe & effective"

#KnowTheRisks #InformedChoice 

Millions of Americans are not getting 2nd doses & their numbers are growing

Looks like there are different 'theories' as why some aren't coming back 🤔

In the end people have a choice about medical treatments & that's always been the beauty of democracy!

In support of Political Freedom of Speech !!

Looks to support my view there may be a place for other treatments

MORE FACEBOOK CENSORSHIP 
A picture of an old digger locked out from The Shrine of Remembrance on Anzac Day - A Vaccine Passport - and police conduct befitting a totalitarian regime in a communist state - was deemed by FB as too ‘’sensitive’’ for you to see. 
Are 😷 on children counterproductive? Listen to two doctors discuss this ....


More evidence that lockdowns & face nappies mandates are counterproductive. 

But, hey it’s never been out the evidence. 


Great work by Florida to give Australia a template for our own ‘Freedom from Censorship’ Legislation. 

However it’s even more important in Australia, because we can’t have foreign social media giants interfering in Australian elections. 

#TrueColours.  In years gone by, the left would proudly argue; ‘’I may not agree agree with you, but I will defend to my death your right to say it’’. 

Sadly, today’s left just want everyone silenced & censored that doesn’t agree with their narrow-minded totalitarian thinking.

They talk in generalities to smear knowing the lefty sheep will follow mindlessly !! 
The Social-Media giants’@censorship of the science, the evidence and expert opinion on Ivermectin is killing people. Tens of thousands of people. Every week. 

They have blood on their hands - and so do those fools that cheer this censorship on. 
A billion reasons why FaceBook would want to substantially lessen competition to Big Pharma’s expensive, novel and experimental potions - from low cost off patent drugs. 

And they must be laughing at how useful idiots from the left give them cover. 

I wonder if there's a financial link between Facebook & Big Pharma?

Perhaps a financial interest in suppressing competition to Big Pharma from cheap early treatments?

Maybe ad revenue from Big Pharma?

If the Federal Government can help fund Queensland's Olympic bid, surely it can help fund the duplication of dangerous road black spots like Heathcote Road Bridge in Engadine & New Illawara Road around @ansto in my electorate of Hughes

#FixDangerousRoads


A leading expert has called for a Nationally consistent approach to quarantine, arguing that some states are working off outdated ideas

He's concerned state governments are running differing quarantine models, which he says puts some cities at higher risk

The Federal government must build & run national facilities for quarantine to be used for emergency situations

Hotels are NOT meant to be quarantine facilities & lives have been put at risk by the stubborn use of hotels that are not fit for purpose

I wonder if we have anything to fear in Australia about Aussies being compromised by China ???

#NationalSecurity


The lefties desire to get their way on EVERY issue knows NO limits !

They will personally attack anyone who disagrees with them & have infiltrated our schools with "political activism & political ideology"

It's DISGUSTING how they manipulate young minds

This is one of my posts Facebook has permanently removed. It’s a proposed bill to Ban Domestic Vaccine Passports within Australia. 
In a free country, you shouldn’t have to produce your medical papers to go to the pub. 

‘f’ stands for fascism. 

Facebook’s censorship of Ivermectin science and research has contributed to the death of hundreds of thousands people.

But the fascists at Facebook think it’s ‘’misinformation’’.

#ABCwatch #ABCMisinformation

Check out the ABC's OWN list of its misinformation

This documents all the errors that the ABC has acknowledged

This is a TAXPAYER FUNDED 'news' media organisation that at times gets it WRONG !!

We need to stop wasting taxpayer money on the ABC !

With a research study finding that a majority of Aussies believe the ABC has an inherent left wing bias, it's time to cut taxpayer subsidies to the ABC

The money saved could fund new roads & hospitals !

FACEBOOK : BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS 

FaceBook’s censorship of the science and the evidence on Ivermectin and Covid early treatments - is killing people. 

Those making these censorship decisions at Facebook have blood on their hands. 
FaceBook’s de-platforming and ‘’taking down’’ of entire pages is the modern electronic equivalent of the fascist bookburners of the past. 

FaceBooks censorship is a threat to our democracy. 
Time for the Federal Government to take over hotel quarantine !!

It has the power do so under the Australian Constitution & we need a NATIONAL approach with NO buck-passing between the Federal & State Governments


Dangerous trees are a growing problem especially in the Shire part of my electorate of Hughes

It's NOT misinformation to have a difference of opinion

The idea that the faceless people of Facebook are purveyors of all truth is OUTRAGEOUS !

ABC expresses “regret” over their serious errors in covering some of the key financial decisions by the federal govt during pandemic

The Therapeutic Goods Administration has confirmed three NEW instances of blood clots in Australia linked to AZ, including the FIRST case here in someone OVER the age of 50

BUT didn't our Health Officials say that AZ is "safe & effective" for over 50s ??

Ontario has confirmed its FIRST case of a rare blood clot in a patient after receiving AstraZeneca

He was in his 60s !

But Aussie Health Officials keep telling us that it's "Safe & effective" for those over 50yrs

Your risk, YOUR choice !!

#KnowTheRisks

They stuff up hotel quarantine, impose a draconian snap lockdown & ANZAC Day services get cancelled again in Perth

Just very sad !!

It's not surprising how quickly Governments get used to using Emergency Powers ...


They just like imposing snap lockdowns in WA don't they ??

You know that feeling of a Government suddenly depriving you of your Liberty. 

Very scary they can do it anytime !! 


To cancel or not to cancel your appointment, it's YOUR choice

At least three Sri Lankans have died of blood clots after receiving AZ, the country's Health Minister told Parliament on Wednesday

Just another sad coincidence

Importance of keeping an open mind

New research shows patients with vitamin D deficiency were 4.6 times more likely to test positive than patients with no deficiency

Very interesting ...

Don't put all your eggs in one basket !!


Know the risks ...

Frequency of side effects appears higher in the younger group of 18-55 year olds at 83% compared to the over 55 age group at 71%

Looks like younger people experience more side effects after the 2nd dose than older people

TROUBLING

I seem to remember Prophet Tim Flannery saying "So even the rain that falls isn't actually going to fill our dams and our river systems"

Looks like the 'prediction' will be swept away by the surging floodwaters

Ignorant groupthinkers went into melt down

Now the evidence mounts that they may have done irreparable harm


‘’Safe & Effective’’ - But some are more ‘’safe & effective’’ than others

They'll tell you anything to have you to line up & get it, but if anything bad happens they'll tell you it's just a coincidence 🤔

If they find a link, then it's just YOUR bad luck

The UN Human Rights Committee has ruled that Australia must “facilitate & ensure” the prompt return of two Aussies who argued Australia has breached international law by preventing their return home because of “arbitrary caps on airline travel”

#HomeNOW

It's so WRONG - legally & morally - to deny Aussies entry to THEIR country

To go down the manic road to ‘Net Zero’ to appease UN Globalists when China is not doing the same & when it continues to build 100s of coal-fired power stations - is to sell out our nation!

What about deaths?

Those receiving AZ had higher rates of reported deaths than those who had Pfizer, "but this is likely because AZ is used in care homes & among elderly people in the community, who are naturally more likely to die of any reason"

It should've been a ban for those under 60  
THE PHILIPPINES suspends it as well. 

So at last count that makes; Canada, Spain, France, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia & Iceland all with suspensions. 


European officials have paused the jab for those under certain ages, but our Aussie officials are having "urgent meetings"

MORE BREAKING NEWS - UK Under-30s to be offered alternative jab to AstraZeneca due to evidence linking it to rare blood clots

This follows review by UK regulator that by the end of March, 79 people had suffered rare blood clots - 19 of whom had died


@DSnagged Read it properly, the numbers are based on the UK infection rates in March - which were around 200 times greater than Australia’s
Rubbish. That might be true of over 30’s in the UK with their high infection rates (of the past0.

But it’s complete garbage to claim the same applies in NSW with our low infection rates. 

On the EMA data, the risk of harm is &gt; than the benefit in 🇦🇺


BREAKING NEWS - The EU's medicines regulator says unusual blood clots should be listed as a very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca jab.

While it could not list specific risk factors such as age or gender, most blood clot cases were women under 60. 
On this latest EMA data, in Australia, with our low infection rates (around 1/200th of the UK in March) the ‘potential harms’ are GREATER than the ‘potential benefits’ for all age groups. 

If we are following the data, Australia must immediately suspend it for all groups. 
Good news, George is on board !

#BigPharma #FollowTheMoney #AbuseOfMarketPower


FOLLOW THE DATA

Many are claiming that the jabs are the reason for the decline in deaths in the UK & they may be right

However, as the graph shows, the decline in deaths from the first wave (when there was no vaccine) virtually mirrors the decline in deaths from the second wave 
The Philippines ranks a lowly 115th on the global corruption index, so their suppression of Ivermectin is understandable. 
Listen to the real experts - not the government bureaucrats. 
Ivermectin denial is a crime against humanity. Those that continue to suppress it and demonise it, deserve to burn in hell. 
They can shove their vaccine passports up their ..... 
It’s beyond criminal, it’s a crime against humanity. 

And those that most actively seek to suppress Ivermectin are the same that argue ‘’the (speculative) benefits outweigh the (unknown) risks” as they push for everyone to be jabbed. 
It was after this post that I was de-platformed by FB.

There wouldn't be lockdowns if early treatment options had been pursued with an open mind rather than just relying on a jab option. Just imagine a world where we could have avoided lockdowns & the economic chaos of blindly following a 'one-option at all costs' approach. Shame! 
LET DOCTORS DECIDE! - It's about medical freedom of choice. The doctors who want to do early treatment, let them do it. Whoever doesn't want to, don't do it, according to President of the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine #freedomofchoice #savinglives #stopgroupthink 
Canada has suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for those under 55 after concerns it might be linked to rare blood clots, with Health Officials saying there's ‘substantial uncertainty about the benefit’ of the jab given the risk of rare blood clots

Follow the money ...


We're paying A$90 billion for 12 diesel subs, at about $7.5 billion each taking decades to deliver. 

Meanwhile, the US Navy has just ordered another nuclear sub for US$2.42 Billion (A$3.17 billion).

What a waste of taxpayers' money! Time for a rethink.


Could it be that #ivermectin may be saving more lives than mass vaccination? Zimbabwe is relying on ivermectin & seems to be doing comparatively better than Israel which is relying on mass vaccination. Just coincidence ... 
Italian doctors keeping an open mind and saving lives with #hydroxychloroquine & #VitaminD. Isn't the role of Doctors to save lives? Well done to those doctors who have saved lives through the early treatment of Covid. #stopgroupthink #earlytreatmentsaveslives

#ivermectin saves lives when given under medical supervision! Great news coming out of Bulgaria with doctors praising ivermectin. #savinglives #stopgroupthink 
How lucky is our generation. 

And just imagine, how these numbers would look if millions had not been denied access to early treatment with Ivermectin, HCQ, Zinc and Vitamin D ? 


If the Vikings were able to grow barley on Greenland, it must have been much warmer than today, long before coal-fired power stations! Somehow that fact doesn’t fit the climate alarmist narrative that C02 works like a control knob to regulate temperatures. 

#AstraZenecaWATCH - A U.S. health agency has issued a statement that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in clinical trial results of its Covid-19 vaccine, potentially casting doubt over published efficacy rates. Troubling!#KeepingThemHonest 
Jab first, ask questions later. 

#ivermectin viewed as a game changer in the Philippines where it's increasingly seen as a low cost & effective way of dealing with Covid in a country facing many logistical challenges. They're just doing their best to save lives! 
A group of Philippine doctors have got behind #Ivermectin for Covid-19 prevention and early treatment with excellent results. What would they know? They're just trying to save lives in the quickest way they can. Well done!! #showrespect #savinglivesnow 
WE ARE COMMITTING ECONOMIC SUICIDE, WHILE THE WORLD USES MORE COAL: US power plants are going to consume 16% more coal this year than in 2020. China & India, which together account for almost two-thirds of demand, have NO plans to cut back in the near term 
LEFTISTS MORE LIKELY TO OVERESTIMATE COVID RISK

Of people testing positive for Covid, between 1%-5% end up in hospital. But a US study found 41% of Democrats believe that more than 50% of those testing positive for covid end up in hospital

NORDIC NATIONS STILL HAVE ASTRAZENECA ON HOLD 

If you just listened to the mainstream media, you’d never know that Denmark, Norway and Sweden have still suspended the AstraZeneca jab because of ongoing safety concerns. #stopgroupthink 
ONE IN 70 TRILLION 

An analysis of the published #Ivermectin studies have found that the chance that Ivermectin is an ineffective treatment for Covid is one in 70 trillion. 

But yet we still have politicians calling it ‘’snake oil’’


I will be voting to have a Royal Commission on Veteran Suicides NOW. My electorate of Hughes includes the Holsworthy army barracks, and veterans have told me they want a Royal Commission now. Let's have a starting date ASAP!!#istandwithveterans 
Questions remain on the AstraZeneca vaccine which is holding up US approval. Looks like the US is being very thorough in its approval process. The unknown risks & dangers with the AstraZeneca vaccine mean we must take extra care with this one. #savinglives 
I will be supporting a motion to establish a Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide NOW. The Senate has agreed and it's the right thing to do. #istandwithveterans #RoyalComissionNOW 
Royal Commission on Veteran Suicide NOW! From Julie Anne Finney: “This mother is tired. I want to see a royal commission, I want to see my son’s case & 700 others investigated. I want the families to have some closure.” #istandwithveterans #Dotherightthing 
A Royal Commission on Veteran Suicide NOW is a matter of national importance with the suicide rate of returned ADF personnel at more than double that of the general population. That's just UNACCEPTABLE!! #istandwithveterans #RoyalCommissionNOW #dontdelay 
ARE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SUPPRESSING THE EVIDENCE ON IVERMECTIN? While a Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has found 21 #Ivermectin studies to review with 2,741 people, Australia’s National Covid Evidence Taskforce have only looked at 10 studies with 800 people. Why? 
German Researchers say AstraZeneca vaccine can cause thrombosis in brain in ‘rare’ cases as WHO says it is ‘not certain’ about it. Who would have thought that scientists would disagree? On this one I'll stick with the German researchers!! 
Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide NOW! Every parent of a lost veteran needs to know why. Has the system or DVA let them down? Could we have done more? We owe them a Royal Commission NOW so they can have some closure. #istandwithveterans 

#ivermectin is sounding better and better as a treatment and prophylaxis under medical supervision. #savinglives #stopgroupthink #keepanopenmind 
You have to ask yourself why frontline doctors who try to bring awareness of or try to use such medicines as #ivermectin & #hydroxychloroquine are being censored. If it saves lives under medical supervision it should be used. #savinglives #stopgroupthink 
Royal Commission on Veteran Suicide NOW! The Federal Government must do the right thing NOW! Delay = More grief to families who have lost loved ones. Veterans have my full support!!#istandwithveterans #RoyalCommissionNOW #Dontdelay 
Warragamba Dam should have been raised to store more water and mitigate floods, but it's been recklessly opposed by climate alarmists & Eco-terrorists now putting homes & lives at risk as Sydney rivers flood after Warragamba Dam spills. #RaiseWarragambaDam 
So typical of Climate Alarmists & Eco-terrorists to stop dams being built or raised & then blame climate change if there's a drought or flood. Warragamba Dam should have been raised to store more water & mitigate floods, but it's been recklessly opposed. 
A Royal Commission on Veteran Suicide NOW is the only decent thing to do to! The Senate stands with veterans, I stand with veterans. Now we need coalition MPs with a conscience to stand with veterans!! #RoyalCommissionNOW

#hydroxychloroquine & #ivermectin being used officially in India under medical supervision. With so many lives still being lost globally, you would think that we would be throwing everything we had at Covid rather than limit our medical response to just vaccines? #stopgroupthink 
ANOTHER FRONTLINE DOCTOR PLEADS FOR IVERMECTIN- "The situation is desperate. I call on the authorities to involve GPs. Personally, I recommend ivermectin. None of my patients have reached the hospital." Suppressing #Ivermectin = Denial of medical treatment 
Check out this interview with scientist & professor Alessandro Santin, head of the Yale University Research Center in the USA about the effectiveness of #Ivermectin against covid. #savinglives #stopgroupthink #followtheevidence 
We need a Royal Commission on Veteran Suicide NOW because of the alarming rate of suicides among serving & ex-serving ADF personnel which has veterans organisations shocked & fearful of ongoing mental health issues. #istandwithveterans  
A big shout-out to the Scientists and physicians from the U.S., U.K., E.U., South America, and Israel who gathered to discuss the latest data on how #ivermectin has reduced COVID-19 cases. #followtheevidence #savinglives 
Warragamba Dam is about to spill over! If we had not wasted so much money on Climate Alarmism to predict that rain would never again fill our dams, we could have actually built more dams to store more water!! #FailureOfClimateAlarmism 
IT'S A CULT. And if you’ve been brainwashed into it, hopefully images of water spilling over the top of the dam (that that the prophet Flannery predicted would never fill again) will jolt you back into a sense of reality. #FailureOfClimateAlarmism #RealityCheck 
Climate guru Flannery flashback : ‘’Even the rains that fall are not going to fill our dams and river systems”.

An entire generation of Australian children has been brainwashed by such garbage. 


With all the rain in Sydney today & dams filling up, you can see the failure of climate alarmism! Remember Tim Flannery, declaring in 2007 that hotter soils meant that “even the rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and river systems”.


A Royal Commission into Veteran Suicides NOW because the suicide rate among Australian Defence Force personnel after returning from service is more than double that of the general population. The Senate agrees! #istandwithveterans #RoyalCommissionNOW 
Vaccinating all adults in the UK is UNLIKELY to achieve herd immunity & fully contain Covid according to a new study. Wow, all that effort & we'll still need treatments like #ivermectin under medical supervision to save lives. Good to know! #stopgroupthink 
Royal Commission on Veteran Suicides NOW!!! Listen to a grieving father speak about the loss of his daughter & you would be heartless not to agree to immediately have a Royal Commission #istandwithveterans #holsworthy 
Israeli scientists & researchers are racing to find a cure for COVID-19, as global consensus is forming among medical professionals that vaccination is not going to eliminate Covid. That's why #ivermectin is so important!! #savinglives #stopgroupthink  
That’s one reason why I’m now Independent - for they know that it’s now pointless to even try. And if it comes to a vote on a Royal Commission on Veteran Suicide, I’ll be supporting it. #istandwithveterans #RoyalCommissionNOW

I’M SURE THIS WAS JUST A ONE-OFF 

AstraZeneca coughed up $5.5 million (£4.2 million) to settle a highly embarrassing foreign bribery probe, amid claims that it faked conferences and offered gifts to local doctors in Russia and China who bought its drugs.


Forget Cancel Culture because one day they may cancel you! From the genius of Michael Rameriz 
I will always stand with veterans! A Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide NOW!! With Holsworthy Army Barracks in my electorate of Hughes, veterans here & around the country have my full support #RoyalCommissionNOW 
The medical experts who have examined the three hospitalized health workers believe that the AstraZeneca vaccine triggered an unexpected & dangerous, strong immune response. Sadly, one of the health workers died. #knowtherisks 
Why was the AstraZeneca vaccine suspended? Because of concerns over previously healthy, relatively young people getting severe blood clots in unusual places at the same time as having low blood platelets. A very dangerous unexpected immune response 
Congratulations to George Braine, of Heathcote, for being recognised as this week's nominee for the 2021 Leader Local Cause Champion. A big shout-out also to Activus Transport for all they do for the local community! @theleadernews 
We must have a Royal Commission on Veteran Suicides urgently!! It's just unacceptable that Australian Defence Force personnel have a suicide rate that is more than twice the general population rate after they leave the ADF #istandwithveterans #holsworthy 
Very troubling that AstraZeneca Vax Flops Against South African Variant in Early Trial. With the real risk that a vaccine may fail against a Covid mutation it becomes even more important to deploy early treatments like #ivermectin under medical supervision 
A high level group of Indian experts is calling for an urgent investigation into each of the 65 deaths that have occurred following vaccination since India started its vaccination program #knowtherisks #transparency #whatwentwrong 
Italian researchers have this to say about #ivermectin - 'While modern medicine cannot do without ironclad evidence, in an emergency situation the use of a cheap medication without major side effects may be reasonable.' #savinglives #stopgroupthink 
Dr. Satoshi Omura, the discoverer of #ivermectin, urges that "special approval should be given" in the fight against Covid #savinglives #stopgroupthink #keepanopenmind


Leading medical professionals & doctors question if key issues regarding the safety of the vaccines were adequately addressed prior to their approval by the European Medicines Agency. Troubling when all safety concerns are not addressed before approval 
Safety comes first in Lithuania: "We are taking the decision because we have three reports about serious, unexpected, unwanted thromboembolic cases in patients who were given the AstraZeneca vaccine in Lithuania" said the head of its medicine authority 
Cyprus has also suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the interests of safety first. But Australia refuses to do so! Cyprus will continue with alternate vaccines like Pfizer/BioNtech in the meantime. And so could Australia!! 
Let’s hope he’s 100% wrong.

MOTION FOR A ROYAL COMMISSION ON VETERANS SUICIDES 

After extensive discussions with the veterans community, and the recent treatment of our special forces, if this passes in the Senate, I will be voting for it’s concurrence in the House. 
Listen to the Doctors - Dr Pierre Kory & Dr. Tess Lawrie. 
As doctors tell the Government to better communicate on the vaccine rollout & not build unrealistic expectations, the Chief Medical Officer tells Aussies not to badger their GPs for an appointment. Is everything under control or are we rushing things?? 
Ever wondered why the AstraZeneca vaccine fell behind in the US? Looks like it may have been as a result of a pattern of communication blunders by AstraZeneca that damaged the company’s relationship with US regulators. Wow! 
A great victory for the people of South African who will get access to #ivermectin under medical supervision after an out of court settlement. Well done to every who made this happen to help save lives! @A_C_D_P 
HYPOCRITES !!

They argue "the benefits outweigh the risks” as a reason to rush the mass vaccination at any cost, but they still recommend against #Ivermectin under medical supervision even though there is growing evidence that it can save lives! #stopgroupthink #savinglives 
Yesterday’s truth is often tomorrow’s error. 
Check out this peer-reviewed research paper that reviews the cumulative body of evidence & recommends the use of #ivermectin in both prophylaxis & treatment of Covid. Follow the evidence & keep an open mind. Thanks @covid19critical 

@PierreKory Thanks so much for what you're doing to save lives. We're all indebted to you and it's an absolute pleasure supporting you & your outstanding work!

BREAKING NEWS from Queensland-Health authorities will delay giving the AstraZeneca vaccine to anyone who is sensitive to anaphylactic responses after four Queensland recipients had alarming allergic reactions to the jab in the last 48 hours. #knowtherisks

They can’t hide the truth forever. 
Congratulations to the FLCCC Alliance for having its peer-reviewed #Ivermectin manuscript accepted for publication! You will be pleased to know the paper concludes that ivermectin should be immediately used globally in the prevention & treatment of Covid. Follow the evidence!! 
Peter McCullough, MD, MPH - this bloke is a deadset legend. 
INDONESIA also suspends the AstraZeneca vaccine, joining the many countries who have already done so because of safety first. Could all these countries & their health officials be wrong? Or are they just being careful not to rush & put anyone at risk? 
Italian prosecutors & magistrates investigate deaths after receiving the  AstraZeneca vaccine. Safety first means you don't keep rushing to vaccine when people are coincidentally dying or facing life threatening blood clots. 
Comrades, even the glorious socialist republic of Venezuela has stopped the AstraZeneca jab!! Surely, all the lefties everywhere will applaud Venezuela for putting the safety of its people first. Shouldn't we just pause the jab for a while to be safe? 
Portugal applies safety first principle  with batches of the AstraZeneca vaccine that were suspended in various European countries after reports of blood clots is NOT being distributed, according to Portuguese health authorities. We need to do the same! 
MATT CANAVAN IS RIGHT - It’s reckless & unconscionable for our health officials to continue to push the AstraZeneca vaccine after Germany, France & Spain suspended its use. Whatever happened to the precautionary principle ‘first do no harm’? Safety first!

Now GERMANY, ITALY, FRANCE & SPAIN have joined the growing number of countries that have suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine. But our Health Officials still push the jab despite the safety concerns. We must suspend too & anyone wanting a jab can have Pfizer!

Troubling that in Switzerland women accounted for 68.7% of adverse vaccine reaction reports, while men only 27.1% - 70.4% of reports not seen as serious, but 29.6% being serious. Deaths have occurred but no direct link established yet. Just coincidence ... 
Are all vaccines 'equal'? Of course not. Will Australians be able to choose which vaccine they get? Of course not. Are Australians allowed to choose an early treatment like #ivermectin? Of course not. When did we lose our freedom of choice??#consumerchoice

THE NETHERLANDS has now also suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine. How in good conscious can our Australian health bureaucrats continue to push this specific vaccine when there are known risks? Safety must come first! #knowtherisks #safetyfirst


Ireland joins other countries in temporarily suspending the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports of severe blood clots in adults. It's great to see Ireland putting safety first and carefully assessing the risks! #safetyfirst 
Whether it's vaccines or climate change, always ask who's going to be making lots of money from it. These are the ones who speak loudly in support of whatever global challenge they are pushing to make them lots of money at your expense #whomakesthemoney

Check out the research and follow the science on #ivermectin as a treatment under medical supervision. Whether or not you get vaccinated, you may still need a treatment if you get Covid. You should at least have the option of a treatment, don't you think? #keepanopenmind 
Is anyone concerned that the science is not fully known on the Covid vaccines? Given you may still get Covid even after vaccination, shouldn't we still be putting in as much effort into researching early treatments? #savinglives #stopgroupthink 
NSW Chief Health Officer notes "medical experts were still learning about how vaccines affected transmission...a lot of this work is still being looked at, and the science is being worked through ...” So, it's ok the science on vaccines is not fully known

The NSW Health Minister has said “vaccination helps but it does not necessarily stop you getting the virus." Wow, all that money being spent on vaccines and you might still get the virus! So, early treatment becomes even more essential 
Censorship kills if it stops debate on early treatments like #ivermectin that under medical supervision can save lives. Sounding more and more like Orwell's 1984. It's so wrong when a herd mentality leads to censorship #stopcensorship #stopgroupthink 
It would be very disturbing if mainstream media were to quietly ‘disappear’ web pages of a story it had reported. Sounds a lot like Orwell's 1984. So, has the Daily Mail deleted its story on the adverse reaction that Australian sailors had to the vaccine? 
BREAKING NEWS: NSW Health confirms a hotel quarantine worker has tested positive for coronavirus, DESPITE getting the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. So if there's a time lag until the 'protection' kicks in, then don't we still need early treatments?

Finally! The NSW Liberal Government has got its act together & restarted the work on the Princes Highway widening in Kirrawee. What a disgrace the project has been! Massive delays!! Huge disruption to local businesses!!! Will the businesses be compensated?

The Czech Ministry of Health has allowed all healthcare providers to administer #Ivermectin Great to see health officials being open minded to save lives with early treatment rather than just rely on vaccines that may be harmful or cannot be taken by everyone #stopgroupthink 
Italians officially turn to #hydroxychloroquine and #vitaminD in their fight against Covid. With so many lives having been needlessly lost, it's time to allow early treatments under medical supervision to save lives around the world #savinglives #stopgroupthink #keepanopenmind 
It's so wrong that early treatment options are being ignored around the world with lives being needlessly lost! We should be rigorously pursuing those early treatment options under medical supervision with an open mind to save lives!!#savinglives #stopgroupthink

Thailand is the first Asian country to temporary suspend the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Health authorities becoming concerned after “side effects or adverse symptoms” were observed in some people who had been vaccinated. #knowtherisks 

At least 10 European countries have now suspended the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Can anyone hear the alarm bells ringing? #knowtherisks 
The rollout of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has been suspended in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia by health authorities to investigate a potentially serious side effect of the vaccine leading to fatal blood clots. #knowtherisks

Health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily stopped the use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine after concerns about the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated.

Listen to the doctor -  Dr. Alexis Lieberman


If you in the Royal National Park tomorrow.eep your eyes open. 


Two US doctors using HCQ + Zinc and Ivermectin as early treatment for Covid. Only 2 deaths from 5000 patients (0.04% case fatality rate). 
Australia’s case fatality rate where HCQ is banned to treat the sick is over 3%. 



#savinglives Great to see that ivermectin is being discussed in Norway with health officials there seemingly open minded about the possible future use of ivermectin under medical supervision 

#savinglives Professor Colleen Aldous, a healthcare scientist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s School of Medicine, says there is compelling evidence that Ivermectin shows good promise in curing people infected with the coronavirus. #ivermectin 

#savinglives If a US judge can allow the use of ivermectin to save a patient's life under medical supervision, why can't Government health officials? #ivermectin #stopgroupthink 
Studies conducted by the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) show the drug ivermectin decreases viral load, prevents transmission of the virus, and reduces mortality in critically ill patients. #savinglives @covid19critical

@constan10101 🙈🙈🙈 

@ChrisBBacon3 How many more trials do you want ? Can’t you see that a ‘trial’ where you deny people access to Ivermectin and give them a placebo only, when we have already have such data, is immoral and unethical? 

@truthful_100 

@michaelkerby2 Obviously you haven’t this read this 
Non-ivermectin group : 50%+ infections. Ivermectin group (788 hospital staff) : zero infections.
@mrgarymatthews It’s an ordinary tablet.
#ivermectin It's all about saving lives!  Whether it's in my Australian electorate of Hughes or anywhere in the world, if only one life could be saved by ivermectin, then don't we owe it to that person to try? #stopgroupthink #savinglives 

#savinglives #ivermectin #stopgroupthink From a Canadian Dr saving lives with ivermectin - 'Effective therapeutics like Ivermectin will help Canadians recover from recurrent lockdowns which are taking huge tolls on Canadian lives. The time is now.” 

#savinglives #ivermectin A frontline Canadian Dr says - 'Ivermectin has the most profound evidence base of efficacy which in my opinion rivals that of penicillin in bacterial infections of the ‘40s.' 
Oh, Katrina Grace - now you’ll have to join the end of the long conga-line of those that will need to apologise and beg forgiveness, when the W.H.O belatedly admits the efficacy of IVERMECTIN and hundreds of thousands of lives should have been saved. 



#savinglives #ivermectin #stopgroupthink Follow the evidence & make your own judgment 

#savinglives From Israel - 'We think ivermectin can help break transmission chain' - Prof Schwartz 

#savinglives 'In the context of a pandemic, the WHO establishes that in the absence of effective treatments, drugs can be used, such as ivermectin, which offers an adequate safety profile, since this drug is used throughout the world and ... has an antiviral effect.' 
A few Ivermectin pills reduced Covid infections by 74% in healthcare workers. 

#savinglives - 12 lives saved by ivermectin in Italy 
More bears. 
This global greening must stop !

A comment from the Medical Association of Jamaica 
Just a thought ... 
What are the Argentinans up to ? 
But, but, but .... there’s no evidence 🙈🙈🙈 

@Auscentrist 

‘’Your Dad’s going to die” the doctor said.

And then they gave him Ivermectin. Watch the video and see what happened. 

Study co-author Professor Paul Marik said: ‘’The data is overwhelming – we are in a pandemic, and this is an incredibly effective way to combat it. If we use ivermectin widely, our societies can open up’’. 


What a surprise !
